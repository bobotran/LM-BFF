It also seems like during this busy IRL spring anime season I will be double spoiled with mixes of really good comedy with heartfelt moments by both Kaguya on Fridays and this on Saturdays. Hope it only gets better Also (bad joke incoming) I feel that between this, Non Non Biyori or Barakamon Japan's secret plan is working Edit: forgot to mention I really love the setting, especially as I'm Polish so it feels a bit more familiar Also I just realised who's voicing the mom.

Just wanted to say that as nice as it is to have a reliable online source for watching episode, I really miss having an air time with a reaction thread and then the serious discussion afterwards.

Technology is fucking great but there is no denying the damage we are currently causing to the environment. Currently they don't have near enough population to cause damage in any meaningful way but it would be nice if they at least touch on it. If the MC's goal is to bring back everyone then It has to be addressed right?\n","213: \t Now the question is, where do the villagers shit?\n","214: \t So not really related to the episode but...

I seriously don't know how it's going to end.\n","231: \t remember when this was just an action anime about defeating titans? yeah… me neither\n","232: \t The emotion that was put in this episode was amazing. I knew that \"Mob Psycho\" was something that Bones Studio really loved, and this episode prove it, then animation is mindblowing, so many different art style, Mob Psycho 100 is a show where every animator can truly express themself, and by watching this piece of Art, we can see that the animator really enjoyed the ride. This is a movie quality show and an important one for Bones and every animator that were in. I am so HYPED Mob Psycho 100 have the best animation that we can have out there so enjoy it guys +great soundtrack\n","235: \t loving how they adapted this\n","240: \t jesus christ we dont deserve such high quality direction and animation\n","241: \t How the fuck do they do it? The animation is so good, so fluid, while everything remains as good as before. We truly don't deserve studio bones' and one's collaboration, I wish I could just sleep till next monday now\n","243: \t We don't deserve this anime.\n","244: \t Didn't even realise there was an after credits scene until I was super confused when my housemates were talking about it.\n","245: \t I've got to say, the choice of early 20th century era as setting suddenly makes a whole lot more sense after this episode - the show has developed a lot of haves vs. have-nots undertones; capitalism vs. communism; those who have the power vs. the greater masses who don't. And the industrial revolution was one of the times in our history where that was the most acutely expressed.\n","247: \t Never thought I'd say this, but Commander (General??) Magath is becoming one of my favorite characters. When he first showed up, I would have bet all my savings he was just a one-off generic Commander set up to die later in that very episode.\n","251: \t I really like the premise of the show. Even though I am not thrilled about some of the characters, I am going to continue to watch just to see the worlds progression.\n","254: \t Iino having Ishigami's former role is fucking hilarious\n","255: \t It is finally here, I loved this series i am so excited for the second season.\n","257: \t Episode 3 did not go as I was expecting at all.

OR THE BEST EPISODE IN EVERY FICTION EVER\n","308: \t I don't know what that says about me, but I can't force myself to like Tsukasa (or Garou from OPM) no matter how hard I try. I'm just intrinsically opposed to their philosophies. Though I know they both have a lot of fans. Really curious to see how Senku gets through this one.\n","315: \t Where are you guys watching this episode so early?\n","316: \t my mind is blanking, what is zeke's current status? is he dead? or like absorbed into eren? or wat\n","320: \t Damn. I’m really gonna miss screaming “Ohayou sekai Good Morning World!” at the top of my lungs.\n","323: \t Finally. Can't wait to see some Anya shenanigans and the classic smug face. Also looking forward to Yor. Best mom and wife. Her cooking skills are not so good however\n","325: \t As a fan of the manga, I must say that I am very happy that the anime has been so well received by all of you!

I don't think I could stand that :p\n","351: \t I'm loving all of these Ace Attorney references. In other news, holy shit Koga Aoi is amazing.\n","353: \t WTF!!! that escalated quickly....\n","354: \t This series has alot of montages with good ost\n","359: \t Something is gonna happen right at the end... I know it... Oh :(\n","361: \t I actually liked it. For me, it was just a healthy reminder, \"Hey... you do realize that LoK is ending, right??\n","365: \t Gonna admit the main reason why I watch this show, more so than all the science stuff, is simply that Senku is just One. Cool. Dude. The way he handles everything and everyone without ever getting flustered or that he is never out of his depth in any situation and solidly takes control is just so entertaining to watch. Yūsuke Kobayashi has done a phenomenal job with the character. His voice acting for both Senku and Subaru has just been so good to see and has made him one of my favorite VAs. Fun fact: he also voiced that side-dude who was banging Minagawa sensei in Scum's Wish ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n","369: \t Man I just couldn't wait any longer. I read 60 chapters of the manga last night. This story is cool.\n","370: \t Naaww\n","372: \t Episode title is \"Hundred Nights and a Thousand Skies\" Byakuya - 百夜 - Hundred Nights Senkuu - 千空 - Thousand Skies Imma lie down and cry more\n","377: \t Uzui's entrance was truly Flashy.\n","381: \t I'm sooo happy this show is back!\n","383: \t MOAR FLASHBACK.\n","384: \t You don't think at sometimes the anime gets darker..?\n","390: \t DO NOT DRINK THE TEA!\n","394: \t I see Ba Sing Se's walls!\n","395: \t i was prepared for a long episode but not for half of it to be spent crying. at least the stupid slapstick humor is still around to cheer me up. also i can already tell im gonna love the shit of out tengen.\n","399: \t There's a 10 billion percent chance I'll fucking lose it if I hear them say this fucking line one more time. Otherwise great show 😄\n","404: \t next arc in part 2 will be dope\n","406: \t oh this started already? nice\n","407: \t So Nezuko just gonna spend this entire arc hidden in her box... ok.\n","409: \t Can we all agree that this episode is probably the most chilling one so far?\n","415: \t Can't believe they had us thinking Grisha was Eren's Gendo when he was really Shinji all along!\n","421: \t Honestly that was better than the manga. We’re in for a ride\n","424: \t I really didnt like the animation of this episode :/\n","425: \t Hey guys where can I watch the new season? It isn’t on crunchy roll?\n","436: \t Tsukasa is the true protagonist. He's like a Dragonball fusion of Senku and Taiju, brain and brawn, Taiju's colour and Senku's gravity defying hair.\n","438: \t ABSOLUTELY ELEGANT\n","439: \t One of the best episode in this series!\n","440: \t i dont usually cry at things, but i spent the entire last 15 minutes of that episode 3 in a complete mess, jesus christ riot well done\n","441: \t as a guy who read the manga watching tsubomi this episode made no sense what so ever LIKE WHAT IS GOING DONT GIVE ME FLASE HOPE ANIME also dat ending\n","444: \t No Ishigami backstory?\n","446: \t uhhh guys where's Lin?\n","447: \t I can confidentally say I have repeated the opening more than anyone else.\n","449: \t Bolin makes me lol\n","450: \t i see so this season will do the whole 'start episodic and then like halfway through or so begin the plot' thing. not a fan. the animation is great and for what it's worth it's still just as 'good' as season 1.\n","452: \t oh man i really missed that show, absolutely hilarious. how very right he is\n","456: \t YURI LOWENTHAL I KNEW IT!\n","459: \t Bakaguya has entered the chat\n","463: \t I'm not sure I like how they show Mob's \"Explosion Meter.\" IIRC in the manga they just showed a number, and I think that works way better. Edit: Actually, I just checked the manga, and they did label it as \"Mob's Explosion Meter.\" However, every time it appeared it took up an entire panel of just text. It probably would have been better if in the anime they just flashed it full screen.\n","467: \t I feel like it has to be explained every week on this sub that genocide is wrong...\n","476: \t Alright, raise your hands if you're now reading the manga?\n","478: \t Just wondering, as this is also listed as comedy on MAL: did any of you find this at all funny? I'm asking because I watched whole episode stone faced. Anyhow, aside from looking nicely, this clearly didn't work for me. I'm out.\n","479: \t Man this show is so fun. I watched the first 5 eps today and was entertained throughout.\n","483: \t It was kind of rushed in my opinion\n","485: \t What a beautiful fighting animation. The episode was perfect.\n","486: \t Calling it now: Makorra.\n","494: \t After last week's episode, the ED is much more poignant.\n","495: \t Animation as usual is superb. i think there’s far too much meaningless dialogue and narration. Many times it’s empty writing. Remember what we all learned in elementary school - show don’t tell. Getting kinda tired of the overly detailed narration which just repeats what’s been said and what is obvious This episode would’ve been much better if it was 15% of the dialogue used. Fight scenes should be intermittent dialogue with just music/sound effects for the most part\n","496: \t Fuck this cliffhanger TBH. That felt very cheap.\n","497: \t While I preferred Good Morning World over this new OP, I will say that I basically died laughing when PELICAN FANCLUB showed up on the screen\n","498: \t Finally! Ma boi Kaseki for the win!\n","499: \t In four years on this sub, this is the 3th time I've upvoted a episode, loved it.\n","500: \t Yuri this episode\n","501: \t You crashed Crunchyroll. Cheers lads\n","502: \t Every single character story is tragic, you can totally see how their decision ends up being the most... Well, not necessarily logical, but at least the one that to the best of their knowledge ends up being the best one they could have chosen at that point. Fuck I'm so ready for season 2\n","503: \t Just thought I'd add my 2 coppers to this thread and say that this episode was quite good. If this show keeps delivering like this, I may just have to use it on the normies.\n","505: \t I just want to see OG Baefong go apeshit on Kuvira and her army, is that too much to ask for or something?\n","506: \t My love for Yor Forger is unhealthy\n","507: \t This show is fucking LIT, I'm gonna recommend it to all my friends now. Holy shit\n","510: \t ok now that I'm engaging with this part of the story for a second time (i got impatient and read ahead) couldnt they of just lowered a bucket down, fill it, lower a lid, then winch the whole lot up. would of been simpler and safer no?\n","513: \t really disappointing that a big portion of the comments here are from manga readers pretending to be anime only, jesus christ\n","514: \t I was hoping to this.\n","515: \t I so wanna punch Kuvira in her face.\n","517: \t The endinggg. So many feels. Was I the only one who cheered like a maniac?\n","522: \t The first 6 minutes (well, 4.5 after subtracting the OP) of the episode was absolutely worthless garbage. No other way to describe it. The actual aquarium outing was thankfully much better, but then the post-aquarium segment felt tacked on. What a weird way to end the season, especially after the way the previous episode ended with them deciding to get a dog and then the dog's own side of things and everything. The first minutes of the episode especially were so awful that I'm tempted to drop the overall season rating to a 7. But the rest was strong enough, so 8/10 it is.\n","525: \t Tengen best character\n","526: \t Any high definition links around?\n","529: \t Does anyone watch this on funimation? It looks like they are a couple episodes behind\n","530: \t Mako is going to receive so much (more) hate from the fandom....... Edit: Let me clarify. The teen girl fandom.\n","531: \t I don’t understand how people can still be rooting for Eren especially since these last two episodes\n","539: \t Do not understand why some people think Eren is a villan.... The whole world want to destroy Paradise Island and the technology is growing rapidly e.g. planes, Battleship. This is the only chance the Eren can do something to save his people.\n","540: \t \"Hmm, it's 4:30am, I have a migraine from an annoying League of Legends game.

I can’t wait anymore\n","542: \t When will we get season 2 or a sequel, and also wow. extremely cute last episode\n","543: \t Tengen feels like the main character of his own show Demon Destroyer complete with a harem and everything.\n","544: \t I loved that they actually discussed things, and how they learned them, plus used them, pretty much the opposite of Lost, or much of Book 2.\n","545: \t Shirogane almost had a Gold Experience\n","546: \t stupid question, wouldn't urine be better for science trick?\n","560: \t smiling all throughout this episode… it’s kinda embarrassing 😭😭\n","563: \t The pacing in this episode is noticeably slow compared to the first and second episode. I guess that's fine since the directors probably want us to get used to the character dynamics first. I do hope the pacing gets slightly faster next week.\n","564: \t Knew he was a bad guy\n","568: \t Will a single episode go by where I don't get goosebumps!\n","570: \t Truly amazing, a very good contender for AOTY. I don't think anything can really come close to it in any way except for Attack on Titan. That ending left me somewhat speechless. I can't Wait for season 2 so I'm gonna read the manga lmao\n","572: \t I just keep liking Meelo more and more. What an adorable little shit.\n","578: \t pretty annoying ep tbh.\n","580: \t Finally my babies Damian and Becky animated!\n","583: \t Looks like Mediafire deleted the episode. Mind uploading something again?\n","585: \t Does anyone think that Zaheer is going to try to kill Korra while she's in the Avatar state, so he can end the cycle? I just don't see how Korra fits into this new world order of his, and waiting until she's in the Avatar state would explain why he didn't just kill her when he had her.\n","587: \t So, was this good? I had to drop it about ep.3 when it turned out it will be \"stupid highschool-level chemistry turned into plot devices, for weebs\". Did it ever do anything else?\n","590: \t ITS THE BEST BOI\n","591: \t Korra is Jefferson Davis.\n","594: \t There's someone missing, someone important. Where is nega-korra?\n","595: \t It should be illegal to make these cliffhanger episodes\n","603: \t This season is quickly building up to a final battle, love it\n","604: \t I love this old style recap intro\n","605: \t in short, THIS SHIT RIGHT HERE made me a grown ass man cry dawggg\n","606: \t Lol Senku is totally going to steal this contest away from Chrome\n","608: \t Too much shit to wrap in 3 episodes\n","610: \t Lol Annie is still a badass\n","611: \t the ed is straight fire holy shit. went in completely blind and the first episode definitely lived up. excited to see how this goes!\n","612: \t you're a fucking idiot if you give reddit money tbh\n","614: \t Oh my god the fight scenes are too good and well animated !! I'm not a fan of LoL but this is definitely one of the best show I've ever seen.\n","615: \t I loved this, can't wait for the rest of the season. Animation was sick, good humor... Very fun!\n","616: \t I remember a time when I actually liked Spongebob. I don't know if I grew up or the show got worse. Probably both.\n","623: \t Imagine Dragons is canon in the LoL universe 🤣\n","624: \t ....kinda want Korra to get with Tahno...WATERBENDERS FO' LIFE\n","629: \t How many references to evangelion could you find in the fight scene?\n","633: \t Hey is this episode lagging like hell for anyone else with the subtitles breaking and pausing?\n","636: \t I really love the aesthetic and animation they use to demonstrate the \"entertainment district\" Also talking about aesthetic, glad they are faithful to the manga character designs, I thought they would dial down some cake due to how popular demon slayer is with all ages, guess not\n","642: \t Man, I did not expect this to be the most emotional show this season.\n","645: \t I liked Connie getting some screen time, has felt like a rarity for him in season 4.\n","646: \t Well, looks like next week I am watching this before Slime, not sure what's gonna happen but I am hyped for that next episode!\n","661: \t I'm trying to find the score used at the last scene.\n","666: \t Wait!it's over already?! Can't believe,it happened so many things but still feels like something that should happen didn't...Nickelodeon Online,you better be working fine next week\n","667: \t Toph went full melon lord. Never be around Toph when she goes full melon lord.\n","668: \t Now that’s what I call character development! I’m so proud\n","675: \t best borf is here\n","676: \t The opening and ending have some stunning visuals. Great start of the season.\n","677: \t Image is ironic\n","680: \t I HAD to comment. No matter how late. I never played LoL, anything remotely league of legends, nothing. I went into this showing zero except maybe that scene of the two girls against the wall but I think the whole internet knows that already. I am so BLOWN AWAY by everything this show offered me. Art direction, music, storytelling, god, the fucking PARALLELS, I'm so done. I need this show to be funded with a billion-dollar budget so I can watch it in its full potential.\n","684: \t it finally clicked to me that Twilight's boss is Solid Snake\n","685: \t Yor is just built different\n","688: \t Man I fell like the world just likes shitting in Reiner\n","692: \t Holy shit 14.5 k ??\n","693: \t the ed made me cry at least 5 times\n","695: \t That ending made me cry...\n","699: \t Loving all the weird faces we are getting more and more with each episode x)\n","701: \t Another week, another dose of Anya reaction faces\n","702: \t A lot funnier than last weeks episode, next week is gonna be lit\n","707: \t Bro no music has ever embodied the idea of 'calamity' quite like what started playing toward the end of the episode. anyone know what it's called so i can listen to it out of the ep?\n","709: \t Senku just loves humanity. It really is what makes him interesting and not just another \"I'm too smart for people to understand me\" type. Cheerleading for the dignity of the human spirit is also the reason I really like No Game No Life.\n","713: \t The close up shots are too hilarious\n","716: \t omg its so good. KINDNESS IS FORBIDDEN IN WAR!\n","724: \t Baldie!!\n","728: \t ALL MY FEELS.\n","729: \t I swear, more I think, the harder it becomes to pick a AOTY. Neverland, Kaguya-sama, Fruits Basket, Hitoribocchi, Sarazanmai, AoT, Maidens in Savage Season, and now this. And this is without counting Vinland Saga (I would've included Chihayafuru but it finishes S3 next year, so it wouldn't be fair).\n","731: \t Did the animation team change again? At the beginning of the episode it had a very Archer feel to the drawing style.\n","733: \t I started watching today, and I’m glad to see it’s as good as the hype.\n","734: \t I wonder what sort of large facilities (newspaper headline) Ostania is building for its citizens to relax.\n","738: \t Good episode, but now I'm thinking about the preview we got for the next one. Are we gonna be seeing Fiona this early? I thought we were still a couple of weeks away from her introduction. I noticed there seem to be three different sections in next week's episode but I'm having trouble figuring out which chapters they are based on their names.\n","739: \t This show is pretty dumb, right? Like it might be kinda fun to watch but no one thinks it's actually good, right?\n","741: \t Did Senku's dad put the location of the village on the coast for it to be spotted the easiest? Coastal navigation is easier then land exploration.\n","742: \t My prediction is with how powerful these 4 villains are, and the fact that there are only three episodes left in the season, we will not see the end of these villains by the end of the season. We clearly know that the red lotus are too powerful for team avatar to handle. The only thing that can prove this prediction wrong is seeing Korra fight them (how has she not fought them yet?) but even then I think she will be overpowered. Also I've noticed a very noticeable lack of Tenzin these past 3 or 4 episodes. Maybe he will come to Korra's rescue? Also, I think Suyin is involved with the Red Lotus.\n","744: \t Wearing that suit like a boss.\n","745: \t Goosebumps all over at thw last scene\n","746: \t I've got nothing to contribute other that this was an amazing character development episode\n","747: \t When's this show coming to Crunchyroll or Netflix? I've only seen season 1 on CR\n","748: \t Anyone else think Korra got hotter?\n","750: \t Waiting for the doujins.\n","752: \t Ya all remember that moment from season 1. With the animation they pulled in this episode makes me wonder what they got for us this time to hopefully one up the previous one.\n","754: \t Not going to lie those pies looked really nice\n","755: \t Can't wait to see this particular fight animated. Hype!\n","759: \t Loved the episode. Wish Senku's hair was a bit toned down though, seems out of place...\n","760: \t Idk the pacing and animation seemed a little off resulting in me sadly not feeling the episode.\n","765: \t A smile a day keeps a fight away. words to live by lol\n","767: \t Confirmed Suika is 3 times stronger than Senku\n","769: \t guys.. which mange chapters covers this episode?\n","770: \t Tsukasa is coming thinking this is a fighting game where as Senku is just gonna age of empires his shit.\n","775: \t Wow I cant believe that just happened.\n","776: \t Really liked that episode, hopefully in the future they act more honest and natural like they did today.\n","778: \t Finally we got to see Historia again and she's as beautiful as the day we \"lost\" her. What a banger of an episode, can't believe we're not even half way through the season.\n","779: \t sakuga psycho 100\n","780: \t OMG THIS EPISODE WAS AMAZING, BEST ONE YET!! Can't wait to see what happens next! Every inch of willpower I have is going into stopping myself from reading the manga, same with Fruits Basket (2019).\n","781: \t Reigen is r/2meirl4meirl.\n","782: \t I really loved the episode, normally I'd just read something like this but I wanted to for once watch the anime with everybody instead of being a manga dork (and /r/manga is imo worse than /r/anime about not liking dissenting opinions so I don't like posting there.) But about half way through the episode all I wanted to do was go start reading the manga. I really liked it. I'll be a good boy though and watch the anime :o\n","783: \t I got emotional when \"Thanksat\" started playing as the episode title showed \"From you, 2,000 years ago\" and started off with Frida + Historia. I'm speechless when I think about the level of depth and backstory Isayama puts in each one of his characters. We barely saw Frida in the entire show and yet she's so attaching. I've been so obsessed with this lore, but yesterday's episode just made it even more haunting.\n","785: \t Yeah, I saw it’s premiere. The episode was good\n","786: \t Seven eps in, OP is still an unlistenable cacophony\n","788: \t Wait hold on. Season two already airing ?????? OH MY GUNESS\n","791: \t MIKU S M O L\n","795: \t I’m legit struggling watching all these shows this season\n","796: \t Fucking outstanding. The music in this final season has continued to amaze me. I can't wait to see what they come up with for the final conflict(s).\n","800: \t I have a feeling that this season is going to make us cry tearbend the most.\n","801: \t ok so this was definitely a WIT episode.\n","808: \t Nothing like a day of playing with your dog. Truly a wonderful experience\n","814: \t Mob a CUTE! A CUTE!\n","815: \t Tengen's wives are beautiful and Daki is hot. This season is just hype\n","816: \t Bewbs\n","817: \t 2Volt is the ultimate scene enhancer.\n","819: \t How are people watching it? I'm not seeing the new episode on Hulu....\n","820: \t If this is not peak fiction then I don't know what is holy fuck\n","823: \t I'm waiting for Jinora to kick some ass.\n","824: \t Kind of irritated that Toph is kind of like Quicksilver in the last X-men movie; uber-powerful, but sorely underused.\n","826: \t God this episode was just Bones vomiting animation budget for like 10 minutes straight it was amazing. It wasn't the super-feels-train that some manga readers were hyping it up to be (I think some episodes earlier in the season did that better) but dear lord was it a great ride nonetheless.\n","827: \t 👌🏻\n","829: \t One of the best episodes I've seen in an anime in 5 years hands down. It took us on a journey getting us invested and paid off. Amazing show 10/10 would watch again.\n","832: \t This was a really great episode, my favorite of the season probably\n","837: \t This is quite the...interesting...arc lol\n","839: \t Who's the VA for Hyouga? Sounds super familiar\n","840: \t Man. Korra's a bitch.\n","844: \t I didn't really notice it in the other episodes, but hey Rohan can walk now. Wonder if he speaks since he should be 3 by now.\n","850: \t Fucking anprim ubermensch has to ruin everything\n","853: \t I'm thinking I'm gonna drop this one now, not particularly interesting. The comedy is minimal IMO. Maybe it gets better later but idk.\n","854: \t why are people surprised that this show is unrealistic , i don't remember it ever trying to be realistic in the first place\n","855: \t Doesn't warrant a 4th week of \"Nani the fuck\" but that ending does warrants a: FUCKING FINALLY! Let's fucking go!\n","858: \t Ishigami bringing his A-game this season\n","861: \t Loid's reactions are my favourite bits in the anime. They really make the humor stand out and the VA and sound design are really stellar. Also, Yor is great.\n","867: \t I legit cannot tell if Armin is joking or not\n","872: \t How many episodes are left after this. Monday’s won’t feel the same after the show ends. I hope that they announce a s3 so that we know that it’s coming but On the other hand I hope they don’t announce it so soon since the wait would probably kill me\n","873: \t I still can't get over how nice the visuals for the OP are\n","874: \t nah, that ending acc scared me a lil\n","878: \t Damn, that episode was haunting and absolutely powerful. The storytelling is just fucking immaculate.\n","879: \t The mad lads did it\n","881: \t This discussion is about the anime right?\n","886: \t Yuri is funny siscon.\n","888: \t Is it just me or are they using a few Jojo stand sounds in this season? &#x200B; like times when things change physically they use Golden Experience's object to living thing changing sound.\n","889: \t I'm glad I held on reading the manga because I can't wait what happens. The animation is so fucking good too and the oil painting sequence was just an extra on already amazing animation.\n","891: \t When the hell is Crunchyroll going to release the episode? It's been over 15 minutes\n","893: \t THIS EPISODE WAS HILARIOUS. I am glad that they took this time to catch everyone up and even so make it light hearted going into the last episodes. I didn't realize how much I needed this until I got it.\n","894: \t what chapter of the manga does it stop off here?, really cant wait anymore because i wanna find out EVERYTHING.\n","897: \t Yor this episode was gorgeous\n","899: \t M O G A M I The arc I've been waiting for ever since I read the manga!\n","900: \t YIP YIP\n","908: \t Can we talk about how Kohaku's tits are sometimes bigger sometimes smaller?\n","909: \t God damn the music in this act is absolutely perfect, all three had absolutely amazing scenes.\n","913: \t Meelo is starting to get pretty obnoxious and is really getting on my nerves. Almost every time he speaks there is some level of antagonism to his words.\n","915: \t I'm an anime only, but I know we have like 15 more chapters, 5 more episodes, and this week's episode just barely covered a single chapter... so uh, definitely a movie right?\n","917: \t I dont like the opening\n","918: \t OH HECK YEAH!!!!!\n","921: \t This episode had me crying like a baby and I'm crying even more since I just realised it's the season finale.\n","925: \t No Asami this episode :(\n","926: \t I’ve gotta know some other opinions on the opening. I thought it was really good. It started really slow then built up\n","928: \t If you think cell phones are crazy you wont believe what will be next lol. Dr.stone and BNHA are the true successors of naruto/bleach. By the time One Piece will end, we’ll have a whole new generation of cosplayers adapting a certain blonde female.. ;)\n","929: \t wow\n","933: \t I felt the Firenation was a bit german in context to the conflict, wasn't it?\n","939: \t Chrome got that Big Dick Energy\n","944: \t I really want Senku to help Kinro already :(\n","951: \t How many episodes will it have?\n","952: \t Best episode so far.\n","953: \t Ouch right in the feels\n","956: \t Thats such a good pilot episode. Im hooked. Anya is so adorable and Loid is very cool.\n","958: \t Sometimes I think \"there's almost no story, I dislike some characters, it's literally just going around slaying demons, what's the point of watching?\" Then Ufotable comes in with the awesome animation again and suddenly I'm okay with just slaying demons.\n","960: \t I absolutely love this anime. Just the sheer process of bringing back the \"old world\" science and technology to the amazement of the new world civilization is both thrilling and satisfying. I love the OP and listen to it almost every day. The ED is the perfect way to end an episode. Just... this is such a good series. Even began reading the manga again (forgot to keep up).\n","961: \t The animation in this episode was so beautiful, Mappa has done such a wonderful job especially with the action scenes..absolute perfection. I was expecting or at least wanted more of the story to unfold in this episode but it really did feel like it went by so quick\n","962: \t Im here once again asking netflix also official streamer i have watched todays episode on netflix they are fast to upload too not take a day like other few animes they stream,im from india\n","964: \t Smash\n","965: \t Really enjoying the show so far. Anya's faces are something else xD The humor in this show is fun as well!\n","969: \t banger\n","974: \t The intro really reinforces the Tarlok = Amon theory.\n","977: \t Even knowing how the Arc ends, it still didn't stop me from shedding a tear. The anime is just as masterful as expected.\n","978: \t I wait to watch this show every weekend with my buddy. With that said, I'm just going to predict what I would say and just say this has been one of the best action shows ever! GET EM MOB!\n","983: \t maybe this isnt the right place to ask.... would this be ok to watch with my 10 year old son?\n","989: \t What’s the song called that played at the end of episode 2 and 3 Trying to find it\n","991: \t This episode kind of remind me of the big fight in Boku no Hero season 3. Great animation, a lot of emotion involved but the fight itself was... meh, just a bunch of flashes shot here and there. Oh well, at least it was flashy.\n","994: \t Please more of Zuko!\n","996: \t Can't wait for the next episode where MP100 spoilers That fight was what honestly made me fall for the manga\n","997: \t Magma w/ another All Might reference lol\n","999: \t Aberham lincoln AVATAR STATE!\n","1001: \t You know an episode is epic when it gets glided this many times. Well done, Studio Bones.\n","1004: \t Jinx is just a Harley Quinn knock off and that is uninspired\n","1005: \t and so now the tutorial has officially ended,the first main quest can begin...\n","1006: \t Varrick=Joules Zhu Li=Newton\n","1007: \t Just teach Nezuko how to fight with a sword and end this show lmao. She will easily become the strongest sword wielder since she isn't overconfident like other demons or destructible like normal humans.\n","1010: \t I very much liked Bolin's dialogue in this episode. Even though it was brief. I'm glad he has his own personality, and not just a rehashed Sokka (not that Sokka isn't awesome).\n","1011: \t Best fucking episode so far. That fight was so epic.\n","1015: \t You guys can’t imagine how much I miss Levi 🥺\n","1017: \t I hear its on hulu if u have it 👍🏿\n","1018: \t So who's betting Kuvira is the baddie this season?\n","1021: \t Well, of all the Legend of Korra episodes I've seen, that was certainly one of them.\n","1022: \t It seems the action and hype will start next week. About time.\n","1024: \t Why couldn't Meelo have been the Avatar!?\n","1032: \t This episode sure brought up some unpleasant memories\n","1034: \t Why does this seem like such an allegory to the U.S. vs Al-Qaeda? Oh well.\n","1036: \t One of my favourite episodes! I really wish each book wasn't 12 episodes :( This should be panned out more! I don't want to think that the finale is around the corner when there is so much badassery that could be thrown in Still one of my favourite seasons though 11/10\n","1038: \t Yukino and Hachiman are indeed a great couple /s\n","1040: \t my first thought when he appeared\n","1043: \t For some reason, just now I realized how absolutely excellent Senkus VA is. He just clicked with the character so good I didn't even realize it. Mad props to him.\n","1050: \t hm not my fave episode. and i guess this was their budget ep to save up time and money for the big final eps. And I gotta say I dunno If I can keep waiting and not read the manga. Cause from all sides I hear: they are preparing to end this season to set up a movie for its conclusion. Which awesome... is the movie coming out this summer? Worldwide? I doubt it. Maybe next year in japan. and then later in western countries. Which is 1.5 years waiting. sigh in short: I am hyped to see a potential blockbuster movie of Attack on titan. on the big screen. Contra I dont know if I have enough willpower not to read the manga until then. XD\n","1053: \t dang I heard a lot of mixed opinions on this so was expecting it to be ok but it was REALLY good and REAAAALLLY unique for a shonen.\n","1056: \t Alright I give up and can't fight it anymore. This episode pretty much locked up Mob Psycho as my favorite anime of all time. Brb going to watch it again.\n","1057: \t 'LS01E08SHITTY.mp4' Awesome specification for the non-HD video.\n","1060: \t HOW WILL WE EVER TELL THEM APART NOW?\n","1061: \t I think they really nailed Chrome in this episode, the voice acting was on point and really captured the character. However, I'm a bit disappointed with how Crunchyroll translated his catchphrase. If you're listening to the voice acting, you'll notice that Chrome says \"yabee\" a lot. This is a Japanese slang word with a lot of different meanings. In the manga, this is translated as \"bad\" (meaning either \"not good\" or \"bad ass\"), but Crunchyroll has given it a different translation based on the context (\"oh crap,\" \"awesome,\" etc). This solution works, but the catchphrase gets lost in translation as a result. Like, what would Crunchyroll do if another character points out his catchphrase? Well, I suppose there isn't always a perfect solution when translating such a different language, and I appreciate the quality on the translation in general.\n","1064: \t Beautiful scene at the end. I'm starting to get excited to see what scientific breakthrough they accomplish every week now. Definite AOTS contender for me.\n","1070: \t So damn HYPED!!\n","1072: \t I found my dream waifu <3\n","1076: \t What a fantastic first part, I will miss Anya antics We meet again in October, now with CSM to make it company\n","1079: \t Omg I can't believe SnK is airing again😍😭 but oh boy the ending got me depressed af. Feels like a foreshadowing..\n","1080: \t Dr. Stone is going to dictate a lot of future anime. World building was already on the rise, and I'm guessing we are likely to see a lot more real world science in future anime's, for sure it will trickle down to more of the B list anime's.\n","1082: \t This show just gets better and better each ep. What a treat every weekend.\n","1083: \t as someone who remembers looking up how to make penicillin a long time ago on the off chance I ever got sent back in time, I'm glad I saw this episode.\n","1085: \t ...DAMN CLIFFHANGERS\n","1086: \t Caitlyn is a delight, so is Jayce\n","1087: \t This show is so fucking good holy shit\n","1088: \t That laugh......\n","1094: \t The veil came off for a bit with the fireworks, but it's with the election that this series shows its true colors for good.\n","1096: \t Hmm I don't see Comcast support cool guess I have to pirate it :|\n","1099: \t Man i really hope we get a lesbian sex scene with Annie and hitch sometime soon\n","1103: \t That was tragic, just wow.

animation didn't really add anything to the work, unlike one Punch man. That wasn't an unfair assessment to make at the time. However, this episode is a turning point in the narrative showing us a bit of mob's psyche. The fights and consequently, all of mob's explosions stand in stark contrast to how we see mob otherwise, and the animation certainly helps emphasize that. The fight's in particular are very well choreographed and have a tremendously good sense of motion, even if they aren't as bombastic as OPM's fights, so that's where the decision to make it super well animated came from.\n","14: \t I'll kill them allll!!! - Eren\n","23: \t So, as far as I understand, does this mean all titan Eldians are related to Ymir? How did the 9 titans and pure titans sperate through the lineage?\n","50: \t I’m glad they actually implemented Mecha Senku in the anime! For those that don’t know, he appeared at the end of chapters to give fun facts and answer viewer questions.\n","51: \t I always thought Annie's dad looked very ethnically different than she did. As with most things in this show, eventually that detail was actually there for a reason.\n","56: \t Sato is becoming more and more suspicious every minute.\n","76: \t My face whenever a new Mob Psycho 100 episode is out Seriously though, the Telepathy club looks awesome. Dat gender bender Mob though!\n","81: \t I actually enjoyed that episode, but I'm glad I read Bryke's post before I did, if I hadn't known why they did it I'd be have quite put out but I understand why they had to do it and for a clip episode it was good, and funny. I also actually enjoyed all the relationship stuff so really like Mako's story. Pissed of at Nick though for cutting the budget of such a good show when really they should be throwing more money at it\n","82: \t It's the first time we rooting for the titans? Am i right? How the tables have turned.\n","91: \t So basically what I'm getting is: If they had landed the Soyuz near any inhabited land mass, humanity would not have regressed. Also 5 NASA scientists (and one singer) combined can't build a boat.\n","98: \t People sayin this episode is plot-armored like the Scouts didn't go through 1 expedition outside the walls, 3 major operations to retake the districts and Wall Maria, a battle in the underground chapel to rescue Eren, 1 battle in Stohess district to capture Annie and 1 to protect Eren and Historia, a coup d'etat, a raid on Liberio and recently a battle in Shiganshina to clear the district from BOTH the Titans and the Marleyan Army. While the majority of the Yeagerists have fought who? Onyankopon?\n","108: \t What kind of cave was Chrome exploring where you can find big solid clumps of various different minerals lying around?\n","129: \t I personally loved the episode, it was the Ember Island Players of Korra. Working with limited resources Bryke did an amazing job of supplying an episode which kept me personally laughing with all the meta humour and absurd stuff\n","133: \t Eska is back to normal (as of now).\n","137: \t Subject 007… James Bond reference? I had big expectations going into this knowing how enjoyable the source material, but even they were shattered! Absolutely fantastic start to a hopefully fantastic adaptation.\n","138: \t AMON IS AN ENERGYBENDER.\n","144: \t Remember this post which pointed out that the different layers of music of the Red Lotus' Theme corresponds to a different member? Anyone notice the music that was playing for a few seconds when Kuvira was threatening Bolin in the train? Yes, it had drums. Guess who has drums as their corresponding music layer in the Red Lotus' theme?\n","156: \t The madlads did it! This is our first all comedy episode in forever and it all landed. Especially Iino trauma!\n","166: \t Eska sound's bitter...\n","175: \t Even if it is the end of the world, this felt like such a relieving episode. things felt normal again. but without the fear of our crew being killed by pure titans.\n","196: \t Now that they got a girl they can start recreating the civilization\n","201: \t I can't decide which I love more — Loi Loi or Lottie.\n","205: \t Lin, NOOO!\n","206: \t That coffee gag had me dying\n","207: \t Wow, props to the ufotable staff this week.

Soundtrack this season has been crazyyyy\n","309: \t Annie speed eating was the best\n","310: \t I mean, would you rather live in a cave, eating wild meat and mushrooms for the rest of your life or live in a village with electricity, noodles, medicine, watermelon, yuri and cola?\n","311: \t \"Please, go on, I enjoy praise.\"\n","314: \t LOL Eska looks scary as fuck.\n","319: \t So....is there a single nation in this universe who's leader is not planning on taking over the world? Cause it seems all but the air nomads have tried it...and that's probably only because they're all dead.\n","322: \t Just curious does it make sense for falcos titan form to be a titan only because of his name\n","327: \t Tell me something, how does someone get drunk seconds after drinking wine?\n","328: \t So what's the difference between Ymir's royal blood descendants and the subjects of Ymir?\n","336: \t So Zeke's just gonna be buttnaked for the rest of the show?\n","347: \t This episode really solidified Mob Season 2 as the AOTY favorite for me at least (which shouldn't mean too much considering the year's only a quarter through). The show really has everything between animation, music, story, fun characters, comedy, action, and feels. Seeing the Ultimate 5's power levels really set the hype for what's to come after the 100% wholesomeness -> 100% anguish of last episode.\n","350: \t I don't think I'll ever get over that shit-eating grin, I just start grinning like an idiot every time I see it\n","355: \t The Kamado siblings pissed off are terrifying as fuck.\n","357: \t This cliffhanger was so sudden.

Studies show that we are more genetically similar to a stranger on the street than our direct ancestors four generations ago. So in other words, 3000 years is enough for it to not count as incest. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Go gettem Senku!\n","508: \t Damn I forgot how cool Hanazawa was! &#x200B; And Shirou/Sasuke is always welcome!\n","512: \t So I see the word \"meme\" survived.

Hilarious.\n","535: \t Senku better pull some political move to get Ruri to marry Chrome instead or we riot\n","554: \t Yay, best girl Sulfy-chan is here!\n","558: \t Found the first episode quirky and very funny, Reigen is reminiscent of Steve Martins conman in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels if you ask me. The humour was on point, so was the animation. Surprised by all the negativity in the thread, maybe it's a more niche humour than OPM, either way I'm giving the first episode 8/10.\n","565: \t Daki: You ugly people are still ugly, even when you try so hard. Me: I felt that...\n","569: \t Great santa still alive\n","584: \t Decent episode , so far episode 7 has to be my favorite and personal best . The best thing that happened in this episode was Kohaku in a swimsuit .\n","589: \t Dr Stone was a cooking anime all along!

I can relate to that \"lying and showing no emotions\" way of living.\n","626: \t Family photo... someone get me a screencap so that I may stare at it for hours.\n","627: \t The slow atmosphere this episode had was quite touching and relaxing, especially in comparison to the first two episodes this season which were more comedy focused.\n","631: \t \"You ruined my wedding!\"\n","635: \t Now imagine for a sec if the headshot had been the mid-season cliff\n","637: \t What an episode, I was really scared because my expectations were really high, But even with that the episode was everything I could ask for.\n","638: \t \"itchy rash\"\n","651: \t I think the only way this episode could have been better is if Loid and Yor punched him at the same time.\n","654: \t The true treasure, was friendship all along!\n","658: \t Such an amazing episode. I love how most of the conversation in the first half had no music. Really let the voice actors carry the emotions. And then the second half was filled with wall-to-wall insane animation. Beautiful atmospheric ending too. My one complaint is that they should have let the episode end on that somber credits sequence. We didn't need a Nin-Nin to break us out of that feeling.\n","665: \t I like that they didn't just jump straight into the next arc, like i was somewhat expecting them too. instead they took their time dealing with the aftermath of the mugen train events. And i quite liked how Nezuko and Tanjiro fought together on the mission they went on. i do hope we keep seeing more of her outside of her box. Can't really say much about Uzui yet, but fans of the manga seems to like him so i look forward seeing more of him\n","670: \t This episode was hot\n","671: \t Emile and Ewen, thine sacrifices shalt never be forgotten, for as long as a carrot lasts fresh.\n","682: \t Wait what’s the death material that they need? Mercury maybe?\n","687: \t as an anime-only watcher, it was interesting to see Mob with such emotions. I think this is the most we've ever seen from him in an episode. Hopefully there's more to come because it makes the show much more interesting!\n","694: \t Love the idea of restarting civilisation and trying to \"race\" back to the previous civilisation, haven't actually looked into any media that does it so I'll be watching this through and seeing how it does it. Off the bat though, there are already some things I don't like much going on here. The MC just looks silly, like something from Yu-Gi-Oh!, but that's just looks really. Otherwise the two characters are alright. Secondly is the how \"realistic\" it is. It reminded me a lot of that Primitive Technology channel in how the MC knows and understands the historical methods used to develop certain technologies, but we don't really see too much of the technical thought processes behind it. It doesn't have to include them, but I thought it would have been interesting to see. Also how they maintain their hair or have some of the clothing they do is another thing. At least they look cool. I like that it leaves some unanswered questions to explore later on. And apart from the obvious questions, how do they plan on have the world function in the future? They show things like rockets, but are they really planning on going that far with developing computers and rockets/planes? How will they do it differently or is it just going to be a replica? The ending indicates it's going to have a lot of shonen elements which ngl, I'm not interested in from this premise.\n","697: \t I hope Kaseki lives long enough to reach their goals. I look forward to him wearing a dwarven exo-suit while assembling their spaceship to reach the moon. This episode is so good, everyone got their chance to contribute and display their uniqueness\n","705: \t Whole episode was good, worth the wait for me, the soundtrack blew me away. But I have just one question. What are those clear threads that lash out at Zeke just before Eren begins to transform into the Founding Titan?\n","712: \t Sexism saves the day??\n","719: \t This fake family sure have some parenting insights.

This episode was way better. I loved Jeans inner struggle to choose between the world and himself/future family. Is that Mikasa he was imagining being married to? I saw a scar on her cheek. Hange was kinda weird. She claims she isn't their superior and then says shes still the commander of the survey corps. She points that all the dead soldiers wouldnt agree with genocide but what about the yeagerist. Many of them were once cadets or in the new survey corps and they agreed with the rumbling why would all the dead soldiers who only knew that humanity lived within the walls fight for the rest of humanity which forced them in this situation, Kinda nitpicky but what I noticed. At 3:20 jean says they tried for years looking for answers. Years: the 4-year timeskip. At 7:57 Hange says they lived in the outside world. This basically comfirms that they tried diplomacy. The only reason hange would have a true reason to go would be to prevent the rumbling. Magaths argument is so weak it just reminds me of gabis argument. I was hoping gabi would of said. Did you see that happen? Armin is naive to think Eren is going to stop at this point. Eren is likely to destroy the entire world. Pieck in titan form is a threat to all of them im sure. Jean kicking Reiner for what he did was truly satisfying. Reiner is spitting death flags at all times I wonder when he'll die. Though the trees were shown about 140000 times(i counted) The way Yelena tore apart the alliance was the best way i could of hoped to be delivered. 8/10 for me :)\n","1: \t Did anyone else notice dimple \"running\" away from the Dash Granny lmao\n","8: \t the teacher's saying Anya had the nerve to fall asleep in first period but he was grabbing his coat and leaving immediately when the bell rang. seems like he doesn't want to be there either.\n","15: \t I'm surprised, I've kinda assumed that she must have been secretly fighting in that ring for a long time, but now we know that it was her first, and last, fight in there.\n","17: \t Our BOI Ishigami. He may dislike Iino's stickler-to-the-rules attitude, but he LOATHES people laughing at someone trying their best. For him, he's kind of ignored them at this point, as seen in him and Kaguya's study episode, but having seen that time and again in Iino over the years, he's likely had enough of seeing it, going so far as he did in this campaign by bringing his skills out in creating that presentation video just to show them what's really what. A hidden chad, he is.\n","20: \t When they came across the Buddha statue still intact, I found it actually really touching that it was still up. Spiritual even, anyone else feel like that?\n","21: \t I like the part when Korra jumped out of the water in a spiny wirlpool of woop-ass.\n","22: \t That explosion when Kinro got the glasses was everything that scene needed and deserved. I think this show will leave me with a lasting impression.\n","24: \t \"I'm going to take a nap.\" - Grandma. I love this lady, I only hope that she doesn't show off any too evil traits, considering she kept hanging that Earth Queen picture up.\n","25: \t just a question does the \"stonning\" (lol) affect all living organisms ? cause I heard some birds and also vegetation wasn't \"stonned\" and also does it just cover humans in a stone layer or does it turn the entire body into stone\n","26: \t different aspect ratio for the next episode, that usually means some serious shit is going down. also, did Reigen just Knee of Justice that spirit out of the old man's body?\n","31: \t I think I got a little too excited when I heard Tenzin mention prison camps. HEIL KUVIRA so...apologies to the people that kept saying that there was still poison in Korra's body. That, and what Toph said makes a whole lot of sense now. Do you think Korra will still meet Zaheer? We still have that unexplained scene with Koorra and Mako at what looks to be a White Lotus prison from the trailer. Maybe she will have to be at peace spiritually before the poison can be removed? so...are we we going to find out what the name of the new Firelord is now or what? The Bolin/Mako dynamic is interesting and it isn't too overly cliched I think--even though the brother v brother thing can be overdone at times. Even Mako and Bolin are having some doubts about their respective lotyalties I kind of Wish Toph was a bit more tough towards Korra, and I think it felt a tad cliched with how Toph was reluctant to help Korra at first, but at least it worked out. It's still classic Toph, and I loved how she basically threw Korra around like it was nothing. Does this mean Toph is basically a weirwood? Lol at Korra trying to sneak attack Toph. You can't beat the Blind Bandit Korra. You can't defeat the Melon Lord hmm...Varrick's use of the spirit vines. I wonder what they intent to do with them Fucking Meelo, loved his line\n","32: \t SUCH ÉLÉGANCE Henry Henderson is the MVP on this episode for the \"Élégance Punch\" on that prick. No one is allowed to make Anya cry. Also the restraint on Loid, that table really soaked the damages\n","33: \t Another good episode. ALTHOUGH! Anya came way to damn close to death! She almost opened the door! Yor having to chase after her is great. I also really like the Loid's female coworker, although her ruthlessness feels like an eventual storyline that will affect Loid's family.\n","34: \t Wait I'm confused. Where did this village come from? Does first generation just mean they were the first to wake up from the stone? And if that were the case how did they know nothing about the stone people or technology? Something like that would have had to been passed down through generations.\n","36: \t \"And what am I going to find, if I get through this?\" \"I don't know. But won't it be interesting to find out?\" This really, really struck deep for me, and is the highlight of the episode imo. Sometimes, the most powerful motivation for someone to recover (whether it be from physical injury, or more powerfully, mental/spiritual injury) is to simply see tomorrow- the fear of the unknown can transform into a little sliver of Hope when all other sources of light seem to have faded.\n","41: \t Yor doing the sexy pose to kill Loid was too much for me... This anime is just too good\n","44: \t The king was a sick man coz he was freestyling he ain’t even know eating Ymir would give the kids powers\n","55: \t Bruh I cant lie it was too annoying. What does Eren have to do before it goes his way lol. Head blown off, Zeke in chains and man ends the episode trapped\n","57: \t Loid actually tried to not harm the dog and it just made him more attractive than he already is lol\n","58: \t Unlike a lot of people in this thread, I really liked the direction this episode went. I understand it as the bounce back from the act 2 low point (the rumbling starting) completing a major theme of the series, the dangers of cooperation. Eren has united the worst of enemies, and I'm so happy seeing Reiner and Annie on the same side as the scouts again. The theme is also shown in Armin solving the Connie problem nonviolently and keeping both friends. When I saw that scene in the preview, I figured Armin would have to beat Connie, and it would be a small scale version of him accepting he has to fight his friends for good. (eren) I like this more though. I liked this episode and last episode for the thematic development, this one more though because the return of Annie really ties back to season one and hits that nostalgia, plus it brings back all the themes from the beginning that it looked like the series dropped. So good!\n","59: \t This episode was loaded with so much that's prime for debate and interpretation on the \"main idea\" of the series. To name a few: Magath's \"justification\" and his glances at Gabi (an Eldian), Annie saying they wouldn't have destroyed the walls--does that change when they begin to kill their friends, Eren telling Reiner that he would've destroyed the walls too--which IMO puts another wrench into the Marley-Eldia blame game that the series has put upon us, us as viewers seeing \"talking\" and \"peaceable\" options fail (what does that mean for the future with Eren and beyond?), is fighting always unavoidable, Armin not wanting to stand by with clean hands, 104th's own means vs ends conundrum, is the ends even worth it?, killing their own people and friends to save a world that might continue to hate them--Lady Azumabito and Yelena put it well, humans will always find a way to fight and the Rumbling only shrinks the population, us that are critical of Eren because we find his strategy pointless must also look at the futility and self-destructiveness of \"saving the world\", does that mean nothing is worth it? Maybe the series is saying that bloodshed won't stop but can be reduced??? AAAAH. THat's way more than a few lmaoo A good number of people are tuning out from the season because the spectacle has died down a bit but for me, this and the last episode have been some of my favorites.\n","63: \t Man magath and shadis having a moment at the end there was moving, it’s hard to imagine those two characters ever getting along. They parallel each other quite strongly as well, both retired soldiers who carry on to teach the next batch of soldiers, sending so many people to there deaths under the pretence of glory for there actions. Both probably regretting wondering the same thing of how happy those people could have been if not for them. Honestly sad to see them both go\n","65: \t So tanjiro was fighting so long without even taking a breath?\n","66: \t Am I the only one that thinks they've made Bolin unbearably stupid? The writing on the wall about Kuvira is unfortunately already there ( I know it's a kid's show but I really wish just once they had a morally ambiguous villain instead of one that is black and white) - so his moment of realization really makes no sense. I know that Bolin is the comic relief but for him to have never put two and two together about how sketch Kuvira's idea of 'aid' is so unbelievable to me. Just bc he's not as serious as the others doesn't mean he has to be a complete idiot. Also how is Kuvira realistically going to hold Bolin in a camp?\n","67: \t Seriously, did Korra EVER done ANYTHING right? Sorry, but with each season, each episode, I thought Korra more stupid than before. First, she just brought in the Spirits, without EVER thinking what it would do. Then all the blunder against the other bad guys. And now continued fail against Kuvira. She seriosly abducted that guy without even thinking who had the guts to torture him? Or that radioing would betray their location? Doh. And then they have a MECHA? Really? That was so... misplaced in the Avatar-world. Sorry but the show is nice, but overall Avatar Korra is a big series of failures, wrong decisions and miscalculations.\n","68: \t Might have missed it, but how did they get the double engine when they weren’t at the village?\n","69: \t Swan has earned the rage of millions. I still find it hilarious that Loid actually DID kill a mosquito\n","75: \t Anya finally aplogized to Damian, and it seems like he has a crush on her! This episode was really wholesome, and amazing. Judging from the after-credits and the preview, it seems like we will finally be introduced to Yuri Briar, Yor's younger brother. I'm really excited!\n","77: \t My headcanon: the reason why they placed the Franky short date chapter after the cooking chapter is because Loid is probably starting to develop feelings for Yor at this part.\n","78: \t Luckily that spear was strong enough to hold Chrome. It would be funny after all that time spent talking about overcoming fear the spear just snaps. Also Ginro seems pretty strong to be able to hold Chrome like that.\n","83: \t Here we can see the gang teaming with the people that have been terrorising killing and basically plotting genocide for centuries? While also plunging paradise into chaos by getting them killed and eaten for as long as they remember by titans elemao. They are traitors, plotting with the people that have been killing their species, genociding using them as fucking bombs against other countries against the person that just wants their freedom and is forced to wipe out the rest of the planet AFTER THEY dECLAREd WAR ON THEM MIGHT I REMINd U. The story is going towards Eren failing but if this anime wants to portray real life until the end I hope Paradise disappears from the face of the planet once the world decides to kill them as they have already done, all of it while we see the face of these traitors in first plan I hope\n","85: \t Ok so maybe my mind was just devoured in wholesomeness but why did anya called up a random person and told them where twilight is ?\n","86: \t Ymirs POV: -Be me -Be a random child from a village -Have your whole family and community slaughtered and be enslaved -Be shot by arrows and hunted -Drown to death and be infected by a parasite and turn into a monster -Come back as a girl and be used as a slave to commit mass genocides and be raped by your enslaver and constantly impregnated -die pierced by a spear, have the children of your enslaver eat your body -serve their bloodline and suffer in eternity after death kms\n","89: \t Up until this episode, most of what I felt toward Mako was disrespect. While I still disrespect him to a certain extent, for example for things such as his immature handling of relationships with others and general downright douchebaggery, he earned a few respect points in my book after his interaction with Varrick this episode. He has information that could ruin Varrick, considering that anyone actually believed him. He is escorted (somewhat of a euphemism there) to Varrick by some thugs probably to some undisclosed location, where he will likely be completely in Varrick's power. Not to mention that Varrick's power and influence have proved to be quite prodigious and definitely a reasonable thing to be intimidated by. Yet Mako enters the room and he seems relatively unfazed. He even makes the assumption that he's going to be tortured over hot coals, and his resolve doesn't falter. The first thing he says, something along the lines of \"you can torture me all you want, but you won't get anything out of me\" is admirably obdurate. Even when Varrick goes so far as to make a palpable threat against those he cares about, he remains unflinching. So yeah, respect to you Mako.\n","92: \t I just watched the Nostalgia Critic's Vlog for \"The Sting\" and it got me thinking about all the crazy things that the characters are doing (the incompetent Lin, Mako getting help from the triads, Bolin being a total d-bag) is a result of the dark spirits screwing up the balance of the world, resulting in everyone indulging their more negative traits (incompetence, aggressiveness, pettiness, war profiteering). Korra's extra horrible decisions may be a result of her connection to the spirit world.\n","93: \t Wait so if grisha kinda saw what eren would do in the future and asks zeke to stop him....why give eren the titan power in the first place? Am I missing something?\n","96: \t When gen and the gang were being chased by hawk eye I noticed he was pulling an arrow back but the bowstring was not with the program\n","99: \t Jean getting to punch the fuck out of Reiner felt, so. damn. good. Such a long time coming since the very first season almost 10 years ago. It felt so cathartic and yet sad because of all the events that have transpired since that make Reiner a more forgivable character. Of course violence begets violence, but I think that a few punches or even a fight to settle the beef is still a good thing and it seems Reiner felt he deserved it too and I agree. I understand all sides and that none of it is fair, but I still can't help but feel like I still side completely with Paradisians. Maybe it's bias or maybe I think that Marley should have upheld their side of the peace. Now we see what their violence has given the world: mass genocide and people left in the rubble on both sides to pick up the pieces. The little people all around the campfire are paying for the actions of their predecessors and people of the past who aren't even alive to deal with it Attack on Titan is unbelievable and I think this episode is a highlight and an example of exactly why I'm rambling, idk if this makes sense, I fucking love this show\n","100: \t It looks like many Reddit fans were right, Korra did seek Zaheer for help, but I like how they did it. Bolin reuniting with Korra & Mako was great. Izumi was awesome too. So it looks like we may have the \"finale\" setup: Varrick & Asami will team up to take out the super weapon, which I was hoping would happen Bolin, Opla, & Lin (Yay!) will be saving the Beifong family Korra & Mako will likely face Kuvira, though I'm not sure what role Mako will play If all these setups play through, then it may be that all of \"Team Avatar\" will be for the most part separated until the last few episodes. Also, we can now confirm every scene from the trailer for Book 4 has been shown.\n","103: \t \"I realized that ladies are really complicated.\" ?!?!? Really? After a whole flash back of Mako not making up his mind and juggling two women at once, the lesson is that LADIES are really complicated? Only if Mako's a girl.\n","104: \t The way kohaku was going around that tree and opening her sword gave me Levi vs female titan vibes\n","111: \t That episode was worth the wait. I was happy to see some old faces again coughTahnocough Tenzin in that airsuit... Hot damn. Kai looked pretty bad ass as well! THAT FUCKING MECH. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Awww, Zhu Li. Go Wu! andPema All those humming mechs, gone in a flash 😦 I do think Kuvira did love Bataar homie... Just not as much as her empire.\n","112: \t \"An even more precious treasure. The treasure of friendship.\" Goddammit, Chrome! I was gonna say that & now I can't. Thanks for nothing.\n","114: \t Last week people said that that ep was the best one so far, and eh, wasn't feeling it. Might've been that I was spoiled for the big moment by youtube the morning of, but it just didn't wow me. This ep did. Eren uno-reversing Zeke's uno reverse. Grisha worming his way back just a little onto my good side. Eren's been the villain (or one of them) for the WHOLE SHOW. I've been spoiled for so much and yet this twist somehow remained hidden. I love that they finally addressed Zeke's insistence that this was all Grisha's brainwashing. He might've tried to brainwash Zeke, but he never did Eren. And we can't even blame Marley's invasion for it, not entirely- Eren was like this even before then. But we sure as hell wouldn't have gotten here if not for Marley. And now Zeke is finally seeing that in a way, his father DID manage to brainwash him. It wasn't the end result that Grisha wanted, but he was so utterly convinced of his world view until this very moment that he never even once considered the possibility that he might be wrong. Eren is the same, in that regard, but Eren's plan might just be foolproof anyway. Zeke's was not. I'm really looking forward to see what Zeke does from here. However, I'm also pretty confident that I know what Eren's plan is, and that he's going to succeed. Eren must've seen the future at least up to this point, and if he's seen this far, there's no reason why events going forward would be any different.\n","116: \t It took hella long to rearm that bomb. Also I don't get why they didn't just attack the floating ship with lightning spears. That'll end things real quick.\n","117: \t How did Yo even get hired in the first place if he's that psychotic? And did he imagine the part where he got shot, since the wound was gone in the interrogation? Its not that unreasonable to shoot a criminal that tried to shoot a law enforcement officer first. Also Chrome would totally be able to fit through one of those gaps there\n","119: \t I’m so surprised how fast the episode seemed to go by. I wanted to know more about Annie and what her part, if any, has to impact the overall story. Perhaps there is a power that the Female Titan possesses that were not aware of that comes into play later? Overall it was a good, nostalgic episode. Returning to the ODM Titan-fighting action that got us all hooked in three first place. I really want to see a close up of Eren’s founding Titan though…\n","120: \t Lol, that Senku profile pic during the texting image\n","122: \t I wasn't expecting the city to run completely on firebender's lightning. I guess it makes sense; why design generators when you have walking lightning generators?\n","126: \t Honestly, if Chrome had been looking at the manual electric plant at the same time as he thought of \"forever spinning machine\", he'd probably would've proposed the waterwheel be used to build a hydroelectric power plant. Great episode! It's starting to get really spicy. I'm looking forward to Homura's role during the coming episodes.\n","127: \t Ah so that's how Pieck puts on her machine gun.\n","131: \t Saying this right now, there's no way his family is dead. It was an effective scene, but I couldn't buy into it fully because I know they're okay.\n","139: \t Suyin really dicked over the anti-Kuvira cause when she decided to try the sneak attack. Also a pretty terrible mom to let her sons come with her, come to think of it. I also have to say that Kuvira really was quite right in understanding Suyin's cowardly nature. She ran from responsibility as a teenager, she hid away from the rest of the world in Zaofu, she refused to help out her neighbors when they fell into chaos for fear of losing what she had (regardless of whatever 'don't wanna be a tyrant' BS she used as an excuse), and failed to even go with Kuvira to try and reign her in as an advisor. Her immediate attempt to get Korra to simply smash up Kuvira's army was likewise not terribly impressive. I honestly don't like Suyin and can't feel too sorry for Zaofu no longer getting the privilege of hoarding their advancements while (as Bolin said and we saw in Ba Sing Se), much of the rest of the Earth Kingdom/Empire is almost unchanged from the time of Aang's battle against the Fire Lord.\n","140: \t this definitely felt more like a recap episode than a \"finale\" but i'm fine with it knowing we have more coming. and i could probably just watch this little family go on cute adventures all day and be satisfied. also, loid quit smoking for anya!!! sir whether you deny or not that is your actual child now!!\n","141: \t Wonder why Anya didn't use her telepathy to give right answer, though it's better if it means she's trying to properly learn. And clearly she can a bit later in the episode. Silly Yor, forgetting to tell her own brother she got married for a week or whatever completely real year. Definitely making your coworkers think you're even more of an airhead. Gotta like Yuri being an upstanding person though. Being angry at a cheating traitor. Even if Yuri is a siscon :P Those flowers are so ridiculous. Man, the same time talking thing makes me wish I could understand Japanese better... easier than trying to read both at once. Good thing that Yuri knows/thinks of Yor as an airhead too (or at least just completely trusts her no matter how ridiculous). Even if Twilight can't believe it. Ohhh THE JIG IS UP THE NEWS IS OUT TWILIGHT FOUND YOU! lol. At least that should help Twilight avoid being figured out, being ahead in the intelligence game. Oh dear god, that flash back to younger Yor. That's a lot of blood. But isn't she just the cutest sweetheart. Why did Yuri not question the blood though? What's your answer, Loidy!? Ah, a fine answer. Now to wait for Yor to catch feelings. YES YURI! Help the ship along!\n","146: \t Ok, Amon just shrugged his shoulders at bloodbending, how the hell did he do that. Also, Tarrlok's bloodbending is really powerful, much more powerful that we see Katara's ever was. Also, if bloodbending was illegal for decades, do you think that after Hama was captured and she spilled the beans, they brought that rule about? Or maybe Katara did something.\n","147: \t Imagine with how \"slow\" some transformations are like the colossal titan just how long it probably takes Ymir to build them with just sand and a water bucket, holy shit, probably in the thousands of years.\n","150: \t Poor Kaguya STONKS going down and getting YEETed. And she's all 👌\n","151: \t Can someone actually calculate how to start a fire like that?\n","152: \t -Armin's character is kind of getting annoying to me. The \"Let's talk this out\" or peaceful way that he always goes gets one dimensional. I want to see Armin fighting and not whining over not being as good as Arwin anymore. I know if Armin changes to the colossal it may be like a bomb (a bit debatable since Bertholdt changed at times that didn't seem to have a noticeable explosion) but I miss it and hope it happens next episode! -Was cool to see Annie and Reiner together in battle -I'm sad we'll only get 2 episodes max of Falco as the jaw titan. Assuming they'll have him make that appearance. -Eren says he cares so much for his friends. Does he really? Cause he should have known they would not want this genocide. Is he the type to care more about self-preservation in the end?\n","154: \t The new ED is so touching. If they cover more family background story of Senku or Taiju's I'll be more than happy. The episode itself is honestly slightly disappointed than I expected for the resolution of the hyped tournament. I can't believe Magma wasn't disqualified by backstabbing Kinro and then the judge just shrugged off and ignored it. Also igniting the cloth by the glass lens is a bit too unrealistic for me even the Dr. Stone's standard. It seems like the actual winner of the tournament is not declared yet. meta prediction Hype for Taiju and Yuzuriha in OP! Looking forward to the second cour.\n","159: \t So the founding titan power doesn't actually require royal blood or touch of royal blood after all? It's a matter of mentality I think. In Ymir's mind she's always a slave who needs the Royal family's permission or follows their order. Eren challenged that fake truth and succeeded!\n","161: \t While others are arguing why Senku didn't make other form of contraptions (pulley system) to get the liquid. I can understand it because of the following: Gas mask is much easier to make given their materials. It is much safer and less of a risk than having a system of several moving parts that may fall apart when exposed to the acidic atmosphere. They may use a gas mask still when making the drug. So they will make it anyway The terrain of the lake is uneven and they climbed just to get there. So moving a system is a huge undertaking. Gas mask is much practical. Gas Mask make them look cool. Got to admit that. &#x200B; I can shrug off that part. But not the part where Ginro save Chrome. That is some strong spear to hold a weight like that. Ginro also is superhuman to hold Chrome which is much more heaver than him. If physics will have a play, the spear will snap or Chrome's weight will topple also Ginro and both of them will be Sulfy Chan's part of the harem. &#x200B; Non-Melting Sulfy Chan is best girl! Got to add that just in case.\n","162: \t Anyway, that Marlean that killed Ymir was based and awesome. It would be great to watch a short series on the subjugation of Marley by Eldia with that guy as the main character.\n","163: \t Senku you cant just steal stuff from class, hides beakers I use for paint. I guess it makes sense that not much science and stuff would remain even tho we have 5 scientists in start. No guarantees they know to much about other fields of study or survival. Brings ramen and hot singers together in space. God gets scared.\n","164: \t The episode felt way too rushed and was mostly choppy written exposition. I was really looking forward to Bolin's reunion with the others but it wasn't given much focus. It really felt like they tried to squish two episodes into one. However, I wouldn't call it a bad episode, just an average one. I was glad to see Raiko finally growing a pair, hearing Izumi's voice and I the dialogue between Korra and Zaheer was pretty good. I love how Zaheer almost felt guilty for what he had done.\n","165: \t Cliffhangers, I want to know Levi state, more about the little girl , also what's with Eren, Armin said he is playing Yelena , I'm sad for Mikasa ,she seems hurt , so if Ere has other motive I will take it ,what could it be ,I'm so curious 🤔 , liked the episode but omg finished fast, I blinked then it is over hehe, all in all I like it\n","167: \t This episode really made me feel for Korra. She was hiding her fear, of course but she also just looked so SAD. She has enormous shoes to fill, coming after Aang. He saved the world. She's living in a city that he established, with a statue of him overlooking her as a constant reminder of who everyone expects her to be. Of course, Aang had big shoes to fill too (especially on Kyoshi island!...get it?) with there being a war he had to end as a 12 year old kid. But there's one thing he had going for him. He had the Gaang TLA always emphasized friendship, and it was their strength that helped him save the world. Korra, on the other hand, just seems so alone. Tenzin tries to reach her, but has plenty of other things he has to worry about as well. Mako and Bolin are friends, but they're not there for her in the way that Sokka and Katara were for Aang. (Especially now with Mako running around with Asami.) At least she has Naga!\n","168: \t Connie killing the two guys made me suddenly hate him he called them both friends then shoots right after I shed a tear\n","170: \t Surely Hange was lying to Floch… right? Absolutely pumped that AoT is back!\n","171: \t KUVIRA, YOUR NAME WILL BE SYNONYMOUS WITH BETRAYAL!\n","177: \t I loved the whole episode. For me, what makes this episode perfect is the terrific composition of Zuckerman. He absolutely utalises musical elements amazingly. As a musician, it is always a joy to write out and play his music. This episode was beautiful, the story development, the characters, the music, the scenary. It is one of my favourites. I particularly liked the fartbending from Meelo. KEEP FARTING ON MAN!\n","179: \t I presume Kuvira has been specifically training to defeat Korra. Whereas Korra just barely got the poison out of her system, hasn't won a fight lately, and still has PTSD.\n","181: \t There are so many sides to this that I'm curious who is rooting for who at this point especially with the Zeke/Eren double betrayal confirmed. I see a lot of people rooting for Eren and that seems crazy to me even knowing he's not on Zeke's side. Who are you guys rooting for?\n","183: \t Honestly everybody, when Tenzin started saying. \"United Forces...\" all I could think was, \"He's going to say America...Oh he didn't\"\n","185: \t That look of Eren's as Frieda spoke... just wow. Palpable rage. Probably the most intense moment he's had (which is saying a lot). So do we take it that he too only just found out the truth of what transpired between Grisha and the Reiss'? If so, who altered the memory?\n","186: \t Such a great episode this week. The reveal of the \"bird titan\" form of Falco makes me wonder why Galliard's form was so different, and why there's so much variation in titan forms. Maybe it was always supposed to be some sort of \"beak titan\"? Or maybe it's just based on a jumble of genetics that the titan holders have inherited, possibly deviating based on bloodlines of the original 3 descendants? And what is actually the female titan's ability? I don't remember Annie doing anything other than getting a pack of titans to eat her titan form, but there's got to be something special, right? So many questions still unanswered, I just hope that it will all be answered before the series ends.\n","188: \t Camilla was great this episode, now i honestly hope she and Yor could be friends and hang out outside of work more. And lmao at the \"My last supper\" when Loid and Anya were about to try out Yor's cooking. Poor Franky. i kinda wanna see how that went down. might not be the last we see of him trying to ask her out\n","193: \t That Eren staredown after he says that to Zeke literally gave me chills... this show is fucking amazing, also Eren just looks badass and cold as hell.\n","194: \t Dat Adult Gaang EDIT: Bloodbending in the middle of the fucking day!\n","200: \t The sequence of Kaguya losing her cool when Chika was pretend married to the President was absolutely hilarious. Same with her freaking out about him on her shoulder sleeping. Perfect voice acting once again, glad to have this show back.\n","202: \t If we get nothing else out of this episode, it's the Fearsome Foursome's conference call. I have to be honest, though, the second sketch with Korra felt a little rushed, but Mako's was okay since we got some character development.\n","204: \t Best part for me was the insert song playing while the hired agents deployed pyrotechnics during his zip line into the tower. Can’t wait to we see if Twilight will have to reenact this in a real life or death scenario for Anya.\n","208: \t Anya portrayal as a child with superpowers she needs to hide is perfect. Papa spy, mama assassin, wakuwkau.\n","209: \t Can I just say I LOVED how both Loid and Yor needed each other for their missions, I can’t wait to see how they’ll fall in love. I also adored seeing Yor and Loid give Camilla what she’d had coming to her being so awful, man that felt GOOD. Honestly being an Anime-only, I initially thought the family was already established and they were all spies; so instead, I am PLEASANTLY surprised to see that the story is seeing how these three become a FAMILY of spies, gah I’m loving this so much~\n","216: \t Minor detail, but DAE notice that Lightning Bolt Zolt (Triad leader who got his bending taken away) had Mako's eyebrows...?\n","220: \t I won't get over Connie's breakdown and the overall tragedy of this last scene any time soon. I am gut-wrenched. Last time I felt this way was during Eren's breakdown at the end of Season 2 when Hannes dies.\n","221: \t These mostly slower paced episodes feel like the deep breath before the plunge, as Gandalf might say. The stories have been excellent, and this episode was no exception. Loved the funny moments with the siblings and Toph pointing out what a lot of us have been saying about the villains since, well, forever (We are Toph, Toph is us?). Plus: Meelo, you little scamp. You're going to give Great-Uncle Sokka a run for his money when you hit puberty.\n","226: \t Well that was uncharacteristically fun one lmao. Some thoughts 1) Interesting how Hange ponders if the reason Levi wasnt turned into a Titan was because of his Ackerman blood. I mean as it happens WE know its because Levi just didnt drink any wine but i wonder if shes right regardless, and if that will become important later. 2) Loved how Falco looked genuinely surprised when Gabi told him Connie was trying to feed him to a Titan. Kid was like \"damn i genuinely thought this was just about Dental Hygeine\" 3) Feel like a lot of people are mad about that Annie scene but if i had been in conscious suspended animation for 4 years my first thought would probably be food too lmao 4) Pieck i get your plan was to rescue Jean and co and that the Cart isnt much in a straight fight BUT if you wanted to quickly snap Floch in two i dont think anyone would mind lol 5) Poor fucking Jean. He wants SO BAD to be self centered dick that only cares about living the good life and yet TIME AND TIME again he cant help but being a good and noble man. 6) I like to think when Hange said \"its up to Armin and Pixis now\" was the EXACT moment Armin thunder-speared him. 7) Was that guy watching Annie Shadis? The silhouette looked like a bald lean man and hes kind of the only unaccounted for character right now 8) Was gonna complain about Hitch not getting to join the crew but then i thought of Marlowe Miche Nanaba Gelgar Levi Squad and every other secondary that spent 5 fucking minutes with these people and was like \"Yknow what probably best you sit this one out sweetie\" 9) That ending was very classic Shonen-y/Avengers-assembl-y which is interesting cause my like lower half brain was like \"HELL YEAH THIS SOOO COOOOOL\" but my higher more critical brain was like \"oh....no... nonono the other shoe is gonna drop any second now\" 10) and Finally poor fucking Reiner. Man trys to get 5 minutes of peace and wakes up to 4 people who have either tried to kill him or beat the shit out of him on multiple occasions\n","229: \t God damn that was tuff man. That ending was brutal. But a few lives are worth the sacrifice to save the lives of the whole world. (And it is cool seeing the armored titan and female titan team up with our main cast) Is there really only two episodes left!? Feels like that is not enough time to wrap the series up.\n","230: \t Everyone's crazy about the Zaheer part but I thought that whole thing was done really sloppily. There was no fight, no struggle - \"Oh, glad you came all this way, here, let me help you out!\" This guy has been imprisoned with no visitors for 3 years, his girlfriend was killed by this same group of people, but he's still willing to lend a helping hand because he REALLY hates dictators! And Korra just seems dumb. \"I thought if I could see your face my problems would be solved.\" She basically had no plan, she just flew hundreds of miles to see Zaheer hoping that just seeing him would solve her problems. Good thing Zaheer was so helpful or she would have gone home empty handed and back to square one.\n","233: \t I like the attention to detail of Mikasa leaving her scarf behind as weather getting hotter this time of year in Madagascar/eldia.\n","234: \t Agree with everyone that the fight scene between Jinx and Ekko was wild. I keep wondering, though, if Powder became Jinx because of the death of her adoptive family and her abandonment. Or if there were soft signs that she was already unstable in episodes 1 and 2 and had the potential to down that path. We could argue that other characters had just as much trauma (like Ekko) but they didn’t end up murdering and hurting people. I feel like the fight scene highlights the similarities between Jinx and Ekko (young geniuses, trauma, poor background) but also the radically different paths they took from that point.\n","238: \t samuel was saved by sasha back in season 1, but now connie -her \"twin\"- is the one that killed him, i guess isayama want to pack parallels in everything?\n","239: \t GINRO FOR THE WIN!!! I was cheering him on so much! I seriously wanted that bastard Magma defeated!! And seeing Ginro put on Suika's glasses and seeing clearly was so awesome!\n","242: \t Eren can control, see, change the future because of his Attack titan ability, founding titan and interaction with royal blood member(Zeke), but my question is how he do that? Ymir choose Eren even though he haven't existed yet?\n","246: \t Man the shot before the fight where we see Vi literally turn her back on Jinx again... however this ends it's going to be brutal\n","248: \t Opening on some kid who is obviously a demon and his human family talking about how well mannered he is, and I’m just sitting here thinking “well yeah this dude is clearly a demon. What’s his deal? He lives with people so maybe he’s a good demon.” Then Akaza shows up, and I start thinking “oh shit maybe not. Who is this kid? He didn’t look like any of the silhouettes of the upper six in the movie. Is it some new character we don’t know?” And he follows it with “I’ve returned Master Muzan.” And I’m just sitting there like “Oh. Well. Obviously.”\n","250: \t \"You're a bad idea!\", Bolin is so fluid.\n","253: \t I didn't think I'd like this as much as I did, but I did. Also, the pure outlandishness of the bad guy shooting his henchman just for suggesting \"what's so important about photos of someone wearing a toupee\" was brilliant. I'm interested in seeing where it goes next.\n","256: \t Incredible choreography- I mean, did you see the way Bumi expertly slid between Ghazan's legs to jump on his back? In all seriousness, incredible fighting in this episode but some things I'm curious about/ predict/ etc. I've noticed that every Bending style has at least two sub skills, Water has Blood Bending, healing, Spirit Bending, Plant Bending etc. Earth has Metal Bending and Lava Bending, Fire has Combustion, Lightning, and Lightning Redirection. Air? All we know of so far is Astral Projection, and Jinora is the only bender we know to have utilized this ability. There must be a new sub skill coming. Is this Zaheer's secret weapon? Or the way to defeat the Red Lotus? Zaheer clearly doesn't plan to kill Korra, he had multiple opportunities. Does he need her body? Then why not toss her spirit into the Fog of Lost Souls? Containing the Avatar is no easy task. Is the Red Lotus aware that Korra lost her connection to her past lives? Bolin seems to have no proficiency in Metal Bending. I know it's been said and speculated before, but perhaps because of his mixed heritage he will become a Lava Bender after all and face off again Gahzan, or more wisely, Ming-Hua. Has no one ever made a plan of action to combat each member of the Red Lotus? Earth Benders give give Gahzan ammo as Bolin said, but Water Benders wouldn't. Ming-Hua needs to be taken on by a Fire Bender and be hit by lightning. We haven't seen lightning used in combat in a while. We know Zaheer is Zaheer and P'li needs to be taken out by the rare Boomerang Bending. I fear Suyin might be a traitor. She said she had traveled with a circus for a while. Zaheer the Acrobat, Ming-Hua, the Water Bending Monster, Ghzan the Volcano, and the Freak P'li. Those are the people that come to mind when I think circus. I know this is underdeveloped but out to dinner with my family. Thoughts?\n","258: \t Like everyone I loved Jinx vs Ekko. However, why did they have to fight? Why did not Vi actually go and fight? She was more focused on well being of Jinx then Zaun. Why did she choose to take Caitlyn? At this point, I thought she chose Caitlyn over Jinx at this point.\n","259: \t I think this episode is the only time the slowing time down effect has ever actually WORKED to give me some sort of feeling. I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t blink, I was just staring in horror for what felt like actual minutes. Am I supposed to cry? Am I supposed to wait a few more weeks for no more Eren dialogue? Will we get actual emotional moments and flashbacks with Armin and Mikasa or no because war? Will Eren actually manage to come back for more of the show? I figured his death was inevitable but this early in was shocking. Zeke’s gotta go. Big dislike. My boy Levi needs to get over being hit with a thunder spear like now. I dislike Reiner. I wish Falco would’ve eaten him but I guess it has to be some form of irony or something that Reiner will continue living even while Eren dies but his side loses the fight (in theory anyway, who knows what actually happens). I feel bad for Gabi’s situation but holy FUCK stop killing my homies off. Armin go big Titan and smash some heads. I need next week’s episode like last week. Fuck.\n","261: \t I like that her eyes are far apart. Makes her look unique. Why did Tsukasa mention that she has blue eyes? What's the significance there? Are they not all Japanese? \"She\" is Kohaku. I hope we're done with flashbacks for a while. They take up a lot of the episode and don't really add much.\n","265: \t When they had to guess Lilians size, i almost expected them to measure up ruri\n","267: \t So Varrick just wants money? To take out the company that some what rivals him? What was the point of bombing the one center?\n","271: \t Exorcist music starts playing when I saw girl 😱 A world where mob doesn’t have Psychic powers😱 This is getting serious\n","272: \t And it's over folks! I was expecting more on the spirits/humans coexistence situation... I guess we're skipping that and going straight to the airbenders abduction, cool. The leader of the largest nation in the world is a total bitch - I sense that \"oppression of the people\" is going to be a big subject this season - I wonder if the anti-avatar team plays a part in this conflict, maybe they have a legit reason for hating the avatar. And why the hell does she need an airbending army? What is she up to that a regular earthbending army couldn't accomplish? Either way, I'm super excited!\n","274: \t If senku is making cola, does that mean we will also learn about how to make cola? :D\n","275: \t I wonder why that filament didn't burned. Though I guess there wasn't enough of current to burn it...\n","276: \t Damn, Loid looked scary with his silhouette visible through the mist. Of course, still not quite as scary as Yor in mama bear mode. It's a bit of a shame that they toned down the ridiculousness of Yor kicking the car. In the manga, it looked like she made it do a full 90 degree turn. Still, it's good to see Keith get his just desserts. Anya pleading to have Bond stay with them was just precious. And it was also wholesome to see Sylvia be so gentle with her. I guess she's got a soft spot for her cause she used to have a daughter her age :(. That's gotta be a sad af backstory. Everything about Bond's arrival to the Forger household made my heart melt. From Anya pacing in excitement, to Bond recounting his hardships as a lab experiment, and now getting to live with the loving family he deserves. Shame that Anya couldn't get another Stella after risking life and limb, but hey, at least she got Bond. Her face after Damian's reaction was pure gold, and voice acting just made it so much better. But man, Anya really blew that opportunity with him with her lack of naming sense. At least that gave us the dog park scene and Anya finding the perfect name. I would've gone for Lucky Vanilla Princess III, but Bond is good too. And his bow tie collar is the cherry on top. I also see Loid feeling all sad about leaving them after his mission, but his new family is giving him more and more reasons to stay. Case in point: just how could he possibly leave after witnessing something as adorable as his daughter sleeping on top of their new dog?\n","277: \t Hayasaka messing with Kaguya's voice volume is simply brilliant.\n","278: \t So Korra lost her memory, right? Maybe Katara could be contacted to try to restore her memory in the way she did with Jet. Korra over hears here caretakers say that Katara died and can't fix Korra, and this triggers the Avatar State causing Korra to gain her memory.\n","281: \t What a lovely episode. First half that continues where we stopped with Yuri asking Yor and Loid to kiss to proof that they are real couple, kiss doesn't happen because Yor even after being drunk just too shy to do it now, and she slaps Yuri accidentally. Later leaves and Loid finds himself envious of Yor and Yuri's siblings relationships. On next day tho, after we get more Anya scenes (not enough Anya in later episodes) who reads Loid's mind and learns that Yuri is from secret police (she has no idea what is it, but \"secret + police= exciting\" for her) and Loid decides to put listening device on Yor just to be sure that she's not aware where her brother works. He ends up being ashamed of that, as Yor proves herself to be the nicest woman who also has no idea who her brother actually is, even after Loid and Franky interrogated her dressed as secret police. That final dialogue between Loid and Yor was especially great. So yeah, this episode was great, can't think of any stuff I disliked about it.\n","282: \t Yah, Chrome! How does Senku know that Ruri is suffering from a bacterial infection? Antibiotics would be useless against anything else.\n","283: \t The death of Nile and Pixis was really sad they were really likeable characters\n","284: \t If only Tanjiro and Inosuke were also still wearing their disguises like Zenitsu. Then Uzui could have said they were his wives, I wonder what Gyutaro's reaction would have been.\n","288: \t Gotta love Chrome. He complained about basically being a damsel in distress, then immediately decided to not be a damsel in distress and get himself the hell outta there\n","290: \t That smile, that damn smile. She is a bit confused but she got the spirit. Yoru training really paid off alright, she completely decked Damian across the room.\n","291: \t I think people are forgetting that Bolin is probably going to be one of the most useful members to take on a secret mission. As goofy as he is, he's the only person we've seen in the world of Avatar today that can LAVABEND. Hard to get reinforcements if you completely block off paths with lava, and it's even harder to earthbend up platforms when the person you're facing can just... add more lava.\n","292: \t \"It seems you and your brother are booked in the same room with only one bed\" \"That's correct. Desden sleeps in the tub\" Yeah I don't think I believe that. Those two are so weird\n","294: \t I saw franky's scene with loud amd almost cried. I don't have a freind like loid near me so I don't even try with girls I am 20 and maidenless. and it is was super relatable to me I am not ugly but fat and the world is very mean to us. Looks is everything when it comes to love.\n","296: \t This anime manages to top itself every week, somehow. This episode started off with some great comedy getting into the school, went into some drama with the interview, and then lastly got us emotional at the very end. Bravo! The comedy on the first half was totally up my alley. I loved the exaggerated jokes and how they were tested meticulously and ridiculously. When they stopped to pay respects to the founder's statue I rofl'ed. And my favorite part...ELEGANT. That instructor is the best. \"Personality: Elegant.\" Lmao. That's the new catchphrase. His pursuit of elegance is to be applauded. The interview was so intense but Anya's mind-reading managed to make it a bit more lighthearted, as her hearing people's thoughts (and reacting to them) always makes the scenes way more fun. Unfortunately the evil instructor completely ruined the mood asking Anya if she liked her real mom or her new mom more, and made Anya cry. I respect Loid walking out on the interview like that, even if it cost him his mission. However, I respect even more that Mr. Elegant stood his ground and straight up socked that evil instructor in the face. He deserved it and it was chefs kiss, elegant. Loid for now has failed his mission but deep down knows he did the right thing to stand up for Anya. Anya however breaking down because she was afraid of losing her new family was the saddest. She wants the mission to succeed not because of some duty, but because it's the only thing that ties her to this new family that she has come to love. And she doesn't want to lose that. This anime doesn't pull its punches - from comedy, to action, then to the emotional tearjerkers. It has it all. (I also find it quite endearing that Anya is a big spy fanatic because Loid is a spy. It's adorable.)\n","298: \t It seems like every main character is just straight up broken. Reiner has been unhinged for years now, Zeke's lost it, Eren might've just been completely played by Zeke, Gabbi is distraught, Porco went full suicide, Falco will probably have extreme PTSD. I feel like this entire season has just been showing the cycle of hatred and violence that happens with war like this.\n","303: \t Amon is the definition of badass. Instead of just not showing up or just taking victory, he poured salt in her wounds. Preyed on her fear.\n","307: \t The episode is titled Treasure, how absolutely fitting. Gosh, this may have been my favorite episode yet. The episode by itself my not seem like much but it's the payoff of watching to this point that makes this episode so magical. I'm a sucker for plot lines with the bad guy being won over by the good guy. Seeing how the strongest man of the village Magma who wanted Senku dead, now has come to grow some respect for Senku is big. The adventures in the cave with Magma, Senku, and Chrome were a nice turning point. Senku stressed how the strong and weak need each other and showed how he cared for Magma through his actions. Magma constantly provoked Senku with lies but Senku never bit on any of it. And I think that's when Magma realized that Senku was someone he could respect. After that... Gen secretly making a surprise birthday gift for Senku along with the whole village was the best part. And it wasn't just any gift, it was make-shift telescope that Senku absolutely adores. You could see how genuinely happy Senku was. They created an observatory just for him. That moment at the end with Senku, Gen, and the villagers under the starry night sky was so precious. Oh how far they've come. Wow. I love this series.\n","312: \t This entire episode is basically a set-up and preparation for coming big fight. In usual anime it's done only a few seconds of training montages, whereas in Dr. Stone they explains every details and it still entertains, the episode flies by and never fells dull. What I liked in this episode is a few character development here and there like Kaseki or the ex-village chief, hell even I I can't remember his name but still impressed by the little conversation with Senku.\n","313: \t Shirogane is like a werewolf, where he becomes practically invincible to Kaguya's advances during a full moon, and even unwittingly does a load of smooth moves on her instead. XD As this is obviously still only the 3rd episode of the season, the show trying to bait me into tears at the 67th Student Council disbanding didn't really work, as I was fully anticipating who or what is going to make the SC continue on. Shame Kaguya didn't volunteer herself as Prez, or we could see Fujiwara begging to not be fired by Kaguya and replaced by Kashiwagi. lol\n","317: \t Episode ends on pretty good fight scene starting, also I liked how Tanjiro's pretending to be a girl Koinatsu saw from the getgo. Also, buff mice of Uzui are pretty fun and it's nice to see Uzui himself acting more serious in the episode. Overall fine episode, even if I can't give a less of a fuck about Zenitsu disappearing cause 1- I know he won't die, cause this is b-tier shounen anime and 2-I'd be actually glad if he died\n","318: \t So many ladies being bamfs in this episode! Korra: Dealing with her shit Opal: Refusing to back down for her man Izumi: Taking a stand for her nation Lin: SUPER SECRET BEIFONG MISSION Asami: Greatest mind in Republic City who will totally KICK YOUR ASS and don't you forget it. I'm just so happy. Edit: Holy shit and I forgot RAAVA (not super sure how gender works for the spirits...). So glad to have her back!\n","321: \t Wine mom Yor is seriously the best, and finding out that Loid wears black pantsu made me laugh way harder than it should've.\n","329: \t Pretty good first episode. Seeing them come up with a way to make and distill wine was really cool to see. I like the relationship between the two main leads.\n","330: \t Sad Yor is somewhat kawaii. I love how Yuri's coworkers are disturbed by the fact that he'd use secret police means to take down her sister's husband just because he hates him. At least, Yuri got to the hospital. That slap was so hard, it made Yor's palm red. Anya waking up thinking it's the apocalypse then sleeping again was hilarious. Franky getting invested in going undercover was also hilarious. I hope he finds love.\n","331: \t I knew Ginro would swoop in at the last minute to save Chrome. Arguably it was a little too convenient how it worked out, but it fits in perfectly in a shonen show like this. And I don't expect this show to suddenly kill off a main character.\n","334: \t Noodliest Noodles? Clearly, Sokka went into the noodles industry.\n","335: \t Yuri: plans to get Loid drunk. Also Yuri: gets himself drunk. Doing a great job as an intelligence officer, Yuri. Your sister comes home from work bathed in blood every single time and you still haven't figured out what her job is.\n","337: \t ooooh, that was pretty clever in the opening to show suika around the sunflowers with her new glasses shining from the light without spoiling this part. kudos to the anime team\n","338: \t Saikawa as Becky. This is Saikawa x Kanna all over again. Perfect casting. Mr Elegant being their homeroom teacher was elegant. That Heh was very elegant. That punch was even more elegant. That class photo was very very elegant! A bolt on the first day is not elegant.\n","340: \t those two science bois linking arms and working togther... ITS TOO GODDAMN CUTE\n","342: \t Nice that she seems to have gotten a friend right away. Becky is apparently voiced by the same VA that made hachikuji from the monogatari series so great, so thats a bonus.\n","344: \t Regarding all the fighting badass-ery, did anyone else think of the spinning ice fans in the Ice dungeon from Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time when Ming-hua was fighting Kya and spinning around with icicles at the end of her arms?\n","349: \t Couldn't senku make a simple gear system to spin the generator with one handle instead of 2? It would make operation easier and doesn't require 2 people to be in perfect sync\n","352: \t Okay, I was wondering if petrification happened to people on the ISS. Who would’ve known Senku’s dad was one of them? Also that shot from space definitely looks like the petrification came from space, doesn’t it?\n","356: \t Poor Reiner will eventually end up as the oldest Man to ever live, just because the Universe just wont let him have his well deserved Rest, HaHaHaHa haaaaaaaaa... What a great episode, i wonder what Hanji, Levi(, Floch) and Historia are doing right now....\n","358: \t You know, if Varrick couldn't have stopped or cancelled the bomb, I'm really curious what the use of this RED BUTTON was! Oh and those eyes... Could not stop laughing. xD\n","360: \t As an anime-only watcher, it looked like Hayasaka intentionally made a big scene out of Shirogane asking for her in order to start the whole rumor mill as revenge for the \"seduce Shirogane\" bit that played out in the earlier scene. And that was awesome. But does that hold true in the mange as well? As in, do these two chapters go back-to-back in the manga too?\n","362: \t Eren, like all Paradisians, was raised to believe that outside the walls humanity didn’t exist. He is simply making that a reality.\n","363: \t So last week was like a 10/10 action wise imo but this was 10/10 storylore wise Some thoughts 1) Loved Eren being a snarky lil bitch. \"yeah no my brainwashings cured yaaay lets go get ice cream\" I laughed 2)Its funny to think that despite how central Grisha is to the narrative he was dead by the second episode of the series lol 3)Im not sure exactly how to phrase it but i feel there was a very strong theme of Irony this episode. Like Eren is the sort of child Grisha wanted in Marley but had in Paradis and Zeke is the sort of child he wanted in Paradis but had in Marley In Frieda and Grishas Confrontation Frieda was being Controlled by her Predecessor while Grisha was being controlled by his Inheritor. Zeke wanted to Free Eren from Brainwashing But Eren freed him. 4) Yknow ive had my ups and down on Grisha. Ive thought he was Good, Bad, Super cool, Morally Complex, just a bit of a dick at several points in the series but in its entirity damn is his life tragic. Sister murdered because of his mistake, betrayed by his son because of his neglect which subsequently caused his wife and closest friends deaths,and then when tried to move on and just live a good life helping others his wife is killed and hes forced to break his moral code and murder children in fit of anguish and rage by his OTHER son. Framed in this light, feeding himself to Eren -while sure yeah was obviously Future Erens intention- almost seems like a straight up grief filled suicide. 5) On a lighter note if you had of told me the end of last season we still wouldnt have a concrete answer on Levis Fate 4 episodes in and FURTHERMORE so much would have gone down that no-one was really concerned by that fact right now, i wouldnt have believed it\n","366: \t Sees Gen gets roughed up and stabbed: \"That was ... random. Is he dead?\" Sees fake blood packs: \"Of course not this is a Shonen not a Seinen.\"\n","367: \t Seems like a bit of an asspull how he survived but meh. Rest of the episode seemed like filler\n","375: \t So it seems the battle us going to start right next episode with all the characters converging toward the battle to help. Since the Oiran lady was alive while sealed in the cloth, Zenitsu should be alive as well just sealed within.\n","376: \t I really liked that Varrik's \"head voices\" sound like Bolin!\n","378: \t Silco loved jinx like a true daughter. The ending will never fail to make me cry\n","379: \t \"Being alpha lemur is lonely\" - Meelo \"I know\" - Tenzin\n","380: \t Back in season one we don't see Grisha's face when he tells young Eren about the key, it cuts from him talking to Carla to the key and then to him leaving the house, and it was all setting up for this. I almost didn't believe I could have missed a clue that obvious so I went to check and it's very cleverly hidden. Just when you think they can't possibly layer any more meaning into S1. It seemed so simple when I first watched it, but even after the Titan Shifters reveal, Ackermann bloodline, Dina, the dream at the tree, you'd think it would be just about full of information layers but now but there always manages to be something else. Even that bird at the start of the episode, just slowly circling over the city instead of flying free, as if it was waiting for Eren's move, that just put all my nerves on high alert. I certainly said \"fucking hell\" a lot during this episode and I stand by that. Seeing Grisha fall apart knowing what his son would become, the echoes of Eren and Zeke through Paths both not there to see very different things, and how twisted that is given why Zeke was there and that moment of reconciliation at the end just when it was too late, it was just hard to watch. I really thought Grisha had just slipped back into bad habits with Eren after Carla's death, that he didn't know how to react except to pass the burden, but it was Eren all along? That's just... I don't know what to think of that just now, I'm gonna need some more time to process all of that. I can't even decide if it was cruel or a small blessing that Eren was hiding Carla's fate from Grisha too though I'm leaning towards the later given who kills her, but the burden that must have put on him not knowing. It never stops does it? The show always has something else to throw at us. I'm firmly convinced that Eren's dream at the tree in ep1 is because of the mix of Founding and Attack Titans, the Attack to see the future and the Founding to break the limits of Paths letting him see it before he's even a titan, but how exactly that will play out I'm both excited and nervous to find out. If Eren has pushed Grisha into murder, forced him onto this path, what else will he touch now he's at Paths? I'm certain he's going to free Ymir somehow, but from Grisha's reaction there has to be something greater he's doing then just that. I see the AoT cliffhangers are back in full force as well. I couldn't believe the episode just ended like that.\n","382: \t Can someone clarify if the attack titan has the ability to see the future then Geisha too must have been able to see it, so what makes eren so special? How was Grisha unable to see through eren's motives? Time travel stuff is always a mess\n","385: \t So on to some good old titan against 3DMG !!! So it continues where it left off on last episode. Eren on the march with the wall titans and seems like almost everyone got the message that he said. Reiner seems like he is absolutely done for and saying Eren can't be stopped. And like I said too. What in the world can stop Eren? Gabbi on the action again. Actually saving Kaya the kid from the farm who was saved by Sasha ironically back in the older seasons \\ . Everyone kinda depressed. Jean knows quite a lot of stuff it seems but damn Conny... Now that they took Falco and I mentioned that usually newly formed titan might be hard to control or just weak. And falco is just fully fainted. Conny wants to use Falco on his mom so that she can turn into human. Jean was like \"Yea let's use him on Pyxis\". And I was like... Hmm.. Ok idea. But Conny straight up \" NO JEAN\". Thanks that Armin somewhat still stable, though in shock suggesting not to use Falco as there is enough bloodshed already. But Conny straight up jumping on Armin too like \"NOPE ARMIN YA WERE SAVED TOO BUDDY!\". And I was like damn Conny.. Yelena is devestated. Zeke is done for too it seems. Shadis is still going strong!!! Let's go dude! Get those recruits up! I really did miss this titan vs 3DMG action! And damn... Armin and Mikasa seeing Pyxis being titan now and they being like \"thanks for everything\". And armin goes to finish his suffering. Oh right, and we see at the end. Eren seems to have taken out all of titans' hardening ability.. Soo Titans like Annie which was hardened all this time is now free. Back to more combat focused episode which is very nice and like I said I'm very pleased to see the actual titan vs human action! Though it seems all the titans just absolutely got demolished here \\ . Will be interesting to see what Annie brings. Overall episode solid 8.5/10. Again looking forward to next week :)\n","387: \t 6 astronauts found a village. 3000 years go by, village is a flint fucking tools level.\n","388: \t Why didn't eren and zeke just touch when eren met him way back pretending to be a wounded soldier? Wouldn't it save them all the trouble?\n","389: \t Tired of seeing Korra get beat up. After 3 seasons it's getting a bit tiring seeing the Avatar get shit on by people she should be able to beat. First season, gets beat up by a NONBENDER. jesus. Second season gets beat up by a waterbending master, but seriously, you have four elements vs. one element DO SOMETHING WITH IT. Third season basically knocked out every episode, who is the Avatar, even? I know it's supposed to be about her struggles, but this is taking it too far. At least give a reasonable argument for why Korra isn't able to do half of the side characters can. Right now it's just Avatar gets saved by sidekicks every single episode and it's just frustrating to watch.\n","391: \t Probably my favorite episode of the series! Dakj is so damn fine. Nezuko’s surprise attack had me pumped and I loved seeing Tanjiro push himself so much that he nearly killed himself. 10/10 episode for me.\n","392: \t I died at Anya saying « Gomen kudasai » to the old man on the bench\n","393: \t using ur own sweat and tears to start a fire to save ur beloved is the manliest thing I've ever seen\n","396: \t They translated Senku's math for the siphon! That was an excellent touch. I had to pause and read through it. Great tangential learning opportunity. I hope Crunchyroll keeps doing it.\n","398: \t Also since those mechas were prototypes is there a chance for a Big O type showdown? Y'know like Koizilla v2 from Korra? Coz that'd be awesome.\n","400: \t I love how Tsukasa rather quickly deduces the exact plan Senku has in mind to free Chrome and prepared a counter strategy, while completely missing the more common assumption that Chrome might break out on his own and did not do enough to stop that from happening. I get it though, because it shows that for all of Tsukasa's brains and brawn, he is not perfect and has weaknesses that can cause the Nation of Science to go head-to-head with him, otherwise this story would end rather quickly! Really enjoying this arc a lot.\n","401: \t Jayce is the little spoon XD i love this sm Edit: I actually hate the situation but I'm choosing to see the positive things out of this\n","410: \t What I loved amongst the many things about these final episodes was that Silco in the end truly did love Jinx. In his twisted and fucked up way passing on trauma. The confirmation that he would've given it all up, his dream right in front of him. Because he would NEVER not for ANYTHING give up Jinx. That makes it more tragic because in the end it was nobodies fault. Everyone was striving for better but in the end. The conflict rages ever onwards. And apparently there's larger players at work who's intentions I have no idea about but now need to do a lore deep dive on the Noxians and this mysterious figure who killed Mel's brother.\n","413: \t We need more credit for the old man who made the masks, he is the real hero here for making all that perfectly glass and paraphernalia while also teaching important lessons to the youngers. Such legendary old man.\n","416: \t such a heartwarming episode made me teary eye fr. and loved the way Anya named him(dog) Bond also the ending scene😭😭😭\n","419: \t Dat replay of Tahno getting hit in the face. Dat commentator's dedication to the job.\n","422: \t I don't think anyone mentioned this yet, but when Mako and Korra were out looking for Bolin, right before they talk to the little kid (Skoochy?), did you all notice the statue of the firebender? I asked out loud, \"Is that Zuko?\" It moved so quickly that I didn't get a good look to see so.\n","427: \t Gotta say, I think everyone expected Kuvira betraying Bataar, but the way it was done we still don't know whether or not she really loved him. Very nice. The giant robot on the other hand, that was pretty unexpected.\n","428: \t So we've got so far: Spy Dad Assasin Mom Stasi Officer Uncle Telepathic child\n","429: \t I want to know what you guys think the title of this episode means, \"The Sting\". I feel like it is either the sting about how Varrick was tricking them the whole time or that Korra now has amnesia.\n","430: \t I’m… not sure I like this Nezuko smile… Ohhhhhhhhhh shit. lmao I suppose that’s one way for Uzui to react when he gets there. Uh. Yeah okay then I had the same “Eh?” reaction that Daki did here. Awwww. Smol Nezuko a cute. lol, I mean he’s not wrong. OH SHIT THIS IS IT! THIS IS THE DEMON I ACCIDENTALLY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF WHEN FRAME-BY-FRAMING THE OP A FEW WEEKS AGO! His name is Gyutaro, huh. Gyutaro makes me very uncomfortable to watch… Looking forward to the rest of this fight though!\n","431: \t I can't believe I guessed that it would be for his birthday, then I started to almost second guess myself. I think at the whole 3 days from now part and the blindfold. More shocked that he thought they'd turn him over. I can already hear the ship builders in here. They really love their evil grins. Ye.\n","432: \t CABBAGE CORP. WAS FRAMED! IT WAS A SET-UP!\n","433: \t \"A crankier, older version of Lin\" I lost it there !!\n","434: \t 17 days late, but the elegance guy was the true MVP this episode. I fucking cheered when he punched that asshole, TRULY ELEGANT.\n","437: \t Bolin finally learned to do the thing!\n","442: \t The old man getting increasingly concerned about young Senku's experiments over time was hilarious\n","445: \t Can anyone help identify the song that plays when Hange is tending to Levi? I remember it playing when Ymir is running away from the chasing villagers in episode 80. Great tone, simple, and solemn.\n","448: \t Bruh, Tsukasa just shat on the Geneva Convetion. Taking a page out of Vietnams book and build freaking Pungi pits lmao, absolute mad lad! Also the second Senku smeared the stuff on the Paper I knew he'd make Micarta, or Carbon Resin at it's called here? Man it feels good to finally know something that's being used and invented here\n","451: \t I'm surprised none of them were harmed by falling into that hole. With a fall from that height you'd at least expect a broken bone or two. Even Senku got out of it without a scratch despite his fragility.\n","453: \t Bolin needs to take his head out of his ass, The Mako and Asami portion was pretty awesome and well done, and amnesia is an interesting twist but i feel as though it was completely unnecessary. The cliche amnesia plot line wasn't overly creative, although my opinion could change next week when we see more of korra\n","454: \t She's fish food!\n","455: \t Jean just not answering Annie’s question was my favorite moment. Silence speaks louder than words\n","457: \t How did Taiju came to know about the phone? And why is Tsukasa letting Taiju and Yuziriha roam freely? Is that the plot armor?\n","458: \t What an episode! Oh man, so many good moments! Zaheer was being unusually awesome. Lin is alive, Opal laying the smack down, Korra's back! Prediction with Zaheer was unexpected but I'm glad it happened. 4 episodes left :( Broken legs lol\n","460: \t Can I just say I am LOVING the 121,548 Varricks of power I see on the side? Same with the 1,511 Zhu Lis.\n","462: \t Gen’s song was very cringe worthy, but I still kind of liked it lol. This episode weirdly gave me a slice of life vibe, which was a nice change of pace. I seriously have been loving this current arc. I’m excited to see the phones in use next episode. Everyone’s reactions are going to be great!\n","464: \t The animation on the part when Chika was Teaching Shirogane was so well-made, holy shit. It's not some flashy fighting sequence, but everything was just drawn so well and the movements are so fluid and realistic.\n","465: \t Fartbending is back baby! Also, Meelo's smile while he wipes the berry juice off his face had me in tears. Great episode of comic relief.\n","468: \t Yuri's real toughness is not on his physical strength, but his tolerance of Yor's food. The strongest part of his body would be his tongue and stomach.\n","470: \t Just a thought I had rewatching Act 2: Why did Caitlyn chose to trade her rifle for the potion? I'm sure she has more valuable and less useful items on her as a Kiramman. At that point in time, she wouldn't know if the potion would really heal Vi or even how much time it needs to take effect. And she knows that Silco's people are after them because she let Sevika lived. I'd think having a rifle to defend themselves is the most important. I mean I'm sure Cait is definitely a good hand-to-hand combatant too but against numerous and juiced up Silco's man is probably a losing battle for her... And yes please give us more Vi x Cait!!\n","471: \t My prediction for the conclusion of this fight: Nakama power overpowers an OP villain.... seriously. It has been established that Mob basically has the same powers as the main villain... however the villain has been storing his powers for 20 years. Since Mob is lacking in psychic power supply, he will eventually have to reach out to his friends and the underlings of the boss to absorb their power. Nakama power for the win!\n","472: \t Really heartwarming to see that Damian's goons aren't just, well, goons. &#x200B; They're really bros!!! &#x200B; Anya and Damian really lucked out in the friend department. &#x200B; Edit: &#x200B; Who the hell is this friend from Class 7 (Cold Steel?)?\n","473: \t Not enough people are talking about Zeke's pre-op scene, I think his cold stare is an indication of his realization that his brother is betraying him. Not sure why/how, but I bet seeing the paths was some sort of enlightenment for him. Maybe, he was able to see the extent of power that Eren holds and he understands that \"if I had that power, I wouldn't be taking orders from anyone--so eren must be doing his own thing.\"\n","475: \t WHILE YOU WERE BUILDING AN ARMY, I STUDIED THE BLADE OF SCIENCE\n","480: \t This one felt like a very lazy animation episode. Lots of the dialogue shots were cut away from mouths which I found odd, like just a top two thirds head so they don't have to animate a mouth, and Annie covering her mouth from the frame while speaking felt uncharacteristic. And then the really low resolution ground texture near the end, and the people walking around the ports at the end looking like Age of Empires 1 resolution, just pixelated blocks moving around. I guess episodes like this had to take a cut to animate some of the more important ones. Hopefully the best are still coming, but it's still in a post rumbling slowdown and might pick up in the movie. As far as the story, yeah, we're getting along with starting to tie together both sides, however reluctantly right now. I was still more with Jean's side than Maggath's, half his argument about things so long ago no one here was responsible for, and the other half was about their responses to Marley trying to kill them all. I think that's not just because these are the characters we grew up with, one is inherited sin and the other is what these people themselves did, the rest is how their victims responded.\n","481: \t I think we're not paying enough attention to HOW FUCKING AMAZING AMON IS. They may be exaggerating on how amazing he is, But he can take away bending, can resist blood bending, AND isn't hurt by the four elements. Amon is the epitome of \"Badass\". I really want to see who he is, But i speculate he's cabbage corp's leader's son. Grandson of the cabbage merchant.\n","482: \t Like everyone has said, this episode was absolutely beautiful. My favorite part of it was actually Katara. I just posted this on my tumblr, but I'll share it here: I love thinking about how Katara sees Korra. Katara is so good-natured that I am sure she tries to see Korra as her own person. But knowing that Korra is the reincarnation of Aang, I think Katara can’t help but think of Aang when she speaks to Korra. This episode subtly confirmed that, and has cemented Katara as one of my favorite characters from TLA well into LoK. I love that Katara doesn’t let Korra’s earlier rudeness offend her. She understands the kind of person Korra is and the difficulty that she’s facing. I love that Katara, instead of being angry that Korra doesn’t seem to appreciate her efforts, tries to intrinsically motivate Korra to learn from what has happened to her. Korra has lost her connection to her past lives, but Katara knew Aang’s soul and helped him to achieve a mission he thought was impossible for him. Katara is doing the same for Korra. \"I knew that someday, Aang would change the world.\" \"I promise you [Korra], if you dedicate yourself to getting better, you’ll recover, stronger than ever.\"\n","484: \t I was so certain Mob was going to hit the 100% during this episode, I was practically waiting for the counter to increment the last few percents when Mogami stepped on Mob's head. But of course it was not going to happen...\n","487: \t The sulfuric acid representation was really terrifying but i feel like the sky light blue palette didnt screamed \"dangerous\" nor \"deadly\".\n","488: \t Yor thought about killing a woman to steal her man. BEST GIRL 2022\n","489: \t Gorilla team so OP they can cook up 1500+ degrees\n","491: \t When they started talking about sulfur I called it ahead of time that they were going to make guns/gun powder. I get a huge kick out of correctly guessing things like this. Also I was not expecting them to resurrect Yuzuriha so quickly. Felt like getting her out of that stone would take an entire season or not at all. Was pleasantly surprised.\n","492: \t Salting the bratty kids was the best! I may have to start carrying some Morton's myself just for this purpose!\n","493: \t Can someone explain the flashback Jean got when he learned that libero would be destroyed I don’t remember that\n","504: \t I know it's a show on a kid centered network, but I keep thinking Korra should have taken the judge or restrained Unaloq. They need proof if they're going to rally everyone.\n","509: \t What Shirogane did was great . Things like this happens to everyone but anyone rarely helps, thinking they got no advantage by doing such thing.\n","511: \t Why didnt they move to a place with more resources like cars and medicine? Instead they started a village from nothing? Why not go somewhere with alot of resources that solidified humans didnt need anymore?\n","518: \t \"I dedicated my life to the military because i wanted to be like you, you're so-\" Mikasa- \"give scorf.\"\n","520: \t I loved the episode, but it raises more questions. The White Lotus still exists, some people thought they were killed off by the Red Lotus after they escaped. But they clearly ask the White Lotus to set up Korra's boat. So where have they been this whole time the Earth Kingdom is in a huge civil warish movement? I was surprised to find Toph in the swamp, I thought she would spend her time with the earth bending moles again. It seems like Korra is afraid of healing and becoming 100%, simply becuase she is unwilling to divulge what she sees to the people around her. People who can act as her guides much like the previous avatars. She has access to Zuko, Kitara, Irroh, etc. But she doesn't tap into this wealth on knowledge, instead she keeps on fighting this internal battle and end up traveling the world searching for answers while one was literally in her back yard.\n","521: \t This is the shit I live for. Yuri is much more memorable in the anime than the manga. I had to do a double take when yor just gave her excuse, Loid was mentally breaking to the point you can hear the sound of shattering in the background.\n","527: \t \"just tell her you're not that into her anymore\" WOW OKAY MAKO YOU WOULD KNOW WOULDN'T YOU\n","528: \t I havent laughed out loud this much from a single episode of anime since Nichijou. HOW DOES THIS SHOW JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER EVERY WEEK?!? Funniest moments for me: Hayasaka imitating Shinomiya saying “se-“ Literally every time Iino walks into the student council room Ishigami knowing all the manga tropes that were coming and still crying Fujiwara blurting out spoilers Bakaguya celebrating pulling Prez’s pants down\n","533: \t Good lord the action and suspense this episode was fucking fantastic. So cool seeing two leaders from two different sides come together(Shadis and Magath). Such an awesome scene Conny sequence was fucking awesome. So was Mikasa, but I'm use to seeing her pop off. Conny going off like that was nuts. Whole crew went off really.\n","534: \t I don't really understand the part with Ymir going back to King Fritz and being his slave. The guy enslaved her people and had his men hunt her down as she ran away for accidentally letting a pig loose. She then obtains supernatural powers by an unexplained spinal creature and goes back to serve King Fritz? She could easily have crushed him, why does she serve him and even protect him from a spear causing her own death? I don't think she ever did die as King Fritz exclaimed that it should not be enough to kill her. Seems she just played dead because she was tired of it and all of her descendants ended up eating her live body, which is now split up amongst all the Eldian people via the tree, which is her own original spine. As she is split further and further, the tree grows more branches. It's seen with only 3 branches when her daughters Maria, Rose and Sina eat her. Eventually it becomes so diluted that people just become pure titans when eating it, and the varied titan shifters just seem to be different parts of Ymir's body that have different traits while all the pure titans are random pieces of whatever. Something that needs to be explored though is the way her descendent blood works. Are all current Eldians descendants of Ymir? Or could any human just consume part of Ymir (her spinal fluid) and become titans, yet this was somehow never tested against non-eldians? Why did she immediately begin working on the wall titans, and were they just laying around before King Fritz from 100 years ago brought them to Paradis?? I was always under the impression that he somehow constructed them. I assume Ymir already knew the future and constructed them in the paths realm, at which point King Fritz (100 years ago) pulled them out of the paths realm to construct the wall. I think it was pretty obvious from the OP that Eren would begin the rumbling, and hints from last episode made it a high probability that he was just going to kill everyone else based off of Grisha's expressions. I wonder what this means for the story. So far the future seems to be immutable, but I'm somehow guessing they aren't just going to let the entire world die. In the trailer for S4P1 it shows some large lady who is not titan sized but seems to be some god-like being. I'm guessing this will come into play somehow. I thought it was the being who gave Ymir her powers, but now we know that about this spinal creature. Finally, waiting for Annie to show up. The rumbling + Eren's full race broadcast has surely waken her up now. That broadcast also confirms that Ackerman's are Eldians as Mikasa was included in it while being a descendant of an Ackerman and an Azumabito. This means titan serum should save Levi if Hange can get her hands on some (apart from the fact that his father is likely an Eldian anyway). I feel like there is also some sort of twist with Historia and her baby that will come into play. So far it was shown in S4P1, but never elaborated on and it seems way too important for them to not touch on again after having shown her again during the rumbling.\n","537: \t Another perfectly adapted ep. This was one of my fav chapters idk how to explain it! When Twilight is trying to get Yor to reveal her true intentions but he comes up blank. I guess it’s a major development in their relationship that I like\n","538: \t will the melon glasses be allowed, or would that count as interference??\n","547: \t Lmao Anya has no respect left for poor Yor 🤣\n","548: \t Wait, meatballs are easier to make than Minestrone? Really? HAHAHA LAST SUPPER ANYA HAHAHA Wow, this is the first time I've seen a \"Actually spoken in a soft voice\" disclaimer. I always wondered how did no one hear characters say secret things out loud in other animes\n","549: \t Ok, Korra's struggles have been interesting, but it is time to get her back in the game. Wu is a DB, the old Earth Queen was a DB, the people actually want Kuvira, and like Varrick alluded to, the other nations don't really care as long as things get stabilized. So at this point I'm not even rooting for Korra to get her act together because I don't know what she is needed for. I'd like her to get healthy on a personal level, but as far as the plot of the show, I'm waiting to see what the real upside is.\n","550: \t Okay so WHAT is the deal with Goth Mikasa? I hope it's just an easter egg...\n","551: \t We finally get to see the needle of the building from the key visual at the final scene. Shimazaki and Serizawa are my favorite characters of the ultimate 5. Shimazaki is a badass but serizawa is something else man. Being taken advantage of when he has great moral intentions is heartbreaking and I love the part he saw what mob experienced only to realize they’re similar. When serizawa saves reigen it shows he truly was misled and can be turned for the better. Seeing minigeshi turn a new leaf (haha) after mogami was pretty great too. My personal favorite part of this episode was when mob talked about the people he was with this whole time with vibrant illustrations being contrasted by sho’s dad in a monochromatic setting with scars on the ground. Whoever was in charge of colors deserves massive applause. This anime is fucking special man.\n","552: \t Motherfucker kicked Mr. Dog! Definitely deserves a stabbing, or at least a roundhouse kick to the face\n","553: \t Anybody else just ride an emotional roller coaster with this episode? I don't think my brain can handle any more emotions right now. For example: the baby is born Aww! He's sooo cute :3 then soon after Lin loses her bending I was brought to tears at the thought of no more bending from that family :(\n","555: \t Watching dad Uzui try to wrangle his rambunctious children was great.\n","556: \t This is lowkey a 5v2 (or 5v1) With Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Tengen, and even his wife vs Upper Moon 6, and they’re STILL getting destroyed. Heck, even Nezuko was involved at some point. And again, this is Upper 6. Akaza must of been something else, and I don’t even want to think about Muzan.\n","557: \t I can't describe the relief I felt when the group approching Miko were supporters not people looking to tear her down. Bless this series\n","559: \t Listen pal. I had to fight off two badgermoles six wolfbats and eighteen hogmonkeys to get these guys, so sorry if I don't have the paperwork! I was too busy cramming it in a hogmonkey's mouth while it was trying to eat me! I am in sore need of a shower and I have blisters that are the size of cantaloupes and twice as juicy! So you can let us through, or you can give me your name and rank and I'll pass it on the Kuvira! You know what happens to soldiers who question her orders don't you? BAD STUFF. Varrick is pretty scary when he's having a bad day.\n","561: \t SCREW JEAN. Damn. Can Reiner catch a break ffs. Jean knows that Reiner had no choice in the Marco death. Reiner was on a mission. Not like he could go back home and say, hey I didn't wanna kill this innocent cadet so I'm back home. He'd be turned into a titan and killed. Really hate Jean and just all the hate Reiner has received in the show. The guy was brainwashed and lied to by his mother. He has no father, was constantly bullied by the other cadets as a warrior candidate. Was a child soldier. Forced to become the warrior leader on paradise when Marcel died. Lost his only friend in Bertolt. Has severe mental issues. Only warrior to make it back to marley. I mean this is all known to everyone in the show, yet they treat him like s**t. Such a shame. Real tough guy Jean. If Bertolt or Falco brother was there, Jean would've been slammed to the ground instantly\n","562: \t Wait it kinda looked like King Fritz died in his bed of old age Then who led all Eldians to paradis to begin with? And who then made the vow rennouncing war? Maybe a decendent being controlled by Fritz?\n","567: \t I don't know about other people, but I felt Reigen's talk with Mob was really off-putting. It didn't seem in character with how caring Reigen really is when it comes to helping Mob, but then he just flies off the cuff for little reason. Maybe there was better context in the manga, but especially coming from how Reigen let Mob not exorcise the ghost family in episode 3, it did not feel like the same person.\n","571: \t \"You can accomplish anything through diligent use of science\" Proceeds to give his kid presents through Santa\n","573: \t I really like that chase part of Inoko, especially the black and white effect when using his beast breathing. We finally see the Upper-rank 6 Demon and I'm sure an influx of fanart is coming. Then we got to see Zenko and him trying to protect one of the budget SumiKiyoNaho despite knowing its an upper-rank demon. I hope he is safe since he basically got kidnapped\n","574: \t The entire school thinking shirogane was about to confess was fucking hilarious lmao, they had a fkn news section 😂😂\n","575: \t I know a lot of people find Meelo a little grating, (cause kids do tend to be a little annoying) but for me Jinora really takes the cake on the annoying meter. Her yelling at Opal just pissed me off. It's the same as when she told Meelo off for wanting to be a general, and for Korra for trying to clear the viness. She is soooo judgmental, and has an attitude that people need to fit within her view of morality. Serious she is definitely my least favorite character from either show.\n","576: \t This episode wasn't as hype and blood pounding as the previous ones, but it was full of gut punches like Eren being responsible for everything. I do feel like it took away from Grisha doing it himself but it was done well enough I didn't mind. I can't believe this episode felt even shorter than the previous ones even with no recap lmao. Although I'm starting to despise the studio for so many damn cliffhangers now. Guess it can't be helped.\n","577: \t Does Eren not being able to control Ymir have implications on the rumbling? Will he be able to control the big bois?\n","579: \t I think the best part about this show is just how human senku is. I mean, sure hes a super genius and all, but he's still human. He makes mistakes. And then there's byakuya. The man was such a devoted father that he literally sent the last hope of human survival on a trip to Japan just so he could try to help his son even a little. And honestly, this show is way more emotional than I thought it would be, and it just keeps getting better. And I don't believe they arent related. They look so similar. But atleast it's less creepy now with kohaku.\n","581: \t I was actually expecting this episode being about teru’s fight. Still I am glad they speeded up the pace. Still I am sad we didnt see teru’s new psychic ability\n","582: \t So they have a car with tiny wooden wheels in a world without any resemblance of even dirt paths let alone roads. While they want to cross a big forest. How is that shit not going to get stuck immediatly?\n","588: \t Good to know that Senkuu was able to convince Gen to join the kingdom of science. Gez was not expecting Gen to attack out of nowhere like that. This Magma guy is really bad news hopefully at the next bout they will be able to beat him.\n","592: \t \"It was hot, I was on a blimp, and I think a giant turtle showed up\", for Toph, Sozin's comet was just Tuesday.\n","593: \t Hearing the song, I understood how Senku felt when eating the primitive ramen. Everyone there loved it, but all I felt was cringe.\n","596: \t Love how the little creature edged away from Jayce when Jayce was onstage. Cool little detail\n","597: \t I found it interesting that Kora seems to be week to earth. The underground fighting was earth bending and she lost, the island thieves used earth bending and she was knocked down, her avatar state spirit self delivered a serious knock-down blow with earth bending, a weak one with water and none with fire or air. Then in light of this she has found Toph, a great earth bender all while who I imagine will become the main antagonist in this is an earth bender. It lines up well with Ang's struggle with fire in Book Four.\n","598: \t Random girl: What kind of girls do you like? Senku: A girl who can pump a ton of oxygen into the furnace. So basically a girl who can blow stuff..\n","600: \t Anya's face after telling Damian she has a dog and him not caring is my favorite moment of the episode.\n","601: \t I started to worry when Nezuko was smiling and having a little too much fun\n","602: \t Alright this romantic love triangle thing is hilarious. I mean, come on! Burning down countries and rainbow-sunset potions! EDIT: Nevermind it's really emotional and horrible now, and i don't even know what to think!\n","607: \t I feel like there would be other ways to take down the spare ship. Like the hundreds of frickin' thunder spears lying around. Or am I missing something here? Magath and Shadis' death were quite unnecessary.\n","609: \t Ladies and gentlemen, this might be the cutest family in anime right here, and they're supposed to be just a \"fake\" one too. The episode's just all around wholesome, but my favorite parts are Anya showing Yor around the house, and the three of chilling by the ledge. It's also adorable how Yor uses formal speech with Anya. And to top it all off, the ED is also completely diabetes-inducing.\n","613: \t Wow, I was not expecting Eren to interfere with the timeline like that! Got total chills watching Eren react to each memory and then change the past. Also, that unexpectedly wholesome moment where Zeke and his dad made up. The fact that this whole episode took place in the paths/past was so cool and I'm so excited based on the title of the next ep, \"From you, 2,000 years ago\" that we'll get some detailed info on the origin of Eldians taking on titan forms. 10/10\n","619: \t I wonder what Senku’s backup plan would’ve been if Chrome lost. I saw this title and definitely thought he was going to make a flamethrower or something\n","621: \t Ukyo was a sonar operator on a submarine huh? Interesting. But that did make me think of all those poor souls in the military who got petrified while serving aboard submarines. Encased in stone at the bottom of the ocean in their giant metal tombs. In any case though looks like the winds are whispering him in his good ears that he's currently standing on the wrong side of this war. Wouldn't put it past it if it turns out there's something specific he wants that Senku and the Kingdom o Science can provide. What that is though, too early to say. And Kraven the Hunter himself, Tsukasa, finally makes his true reappearance. Still, Chrome being captured, not awesome. And that moment when everyone realized Kohaku's point about Chrome's (in)ability to keep his big yap shut, priceless. Hey, least Senku called Kohaku Lioness to stop her instead of Gorilla. Homora looks like she's doing just swell in prison. Oh boy, the Kingdom of Science is about to get a crash course in Auto Shop. But everyone certainly looks dapper in those Industrial Revolution Era clothes.\n","628: \t Well that was a nice moment that Chrome had to ruin by calling Kohaku a gorilla. Good to see Ginrou over come his fear to save the day at the end.\n","630: \t General Iroh. Zuko's grandson. I can die happy.\n","634: \t Damn! That was a good episode! I was actually nervous! Kohaku!!! Don't even joke about a relationship with Chrome! You are Senkuu's girl!\n","639: \t Fun Fact! Tungsten is a swedish word that means Heavy rock(tung = Heavy, Rock=sten) scheelite is from the last name of the swede that discovered it - Scheele BUT in Sweden NO ONE calls Tungsten, Tungsten instead we use the name Wolfram, same as its periodic symbol W(74) When I was watching the episode I was like TUNGSTEN WHAT IS THAT ? heavy rock ?!?!!? and then I was like OAAAh oh yeah they mean Wolfram. I was hoping that someone was gonna leave Tsukasa camp when Senku was holding a freaking Christmas party.\n","640: \t This is the pinnacle. I don't think my eyes or mind have even comprehended yet that I am watching an anime pull of this visual masterpiece. The way they inserted the slow impactful moments in this episode just elevated and balanced the action to make it so much more meaningful. I'm used to shows giving me chills but to maintain it throughout like this is unheard of for me. And the relentless surprises just keep my adrenaline running from Tanjiro combining breathes, combo attacking with the rest and then seeing them go down. Each moment gave me shivers, especially seeing Inosuke's growth and Zenitsu almost as an entirely new and mature person. My heart really was struggling keeping up with these ups and down. Just an incredible viewing experience 🔥\n","641: \t Good episode! I'm bummed Yuzuriha lost her beautiful long hair but she's still great. There was a lot of flashback but I enjoyed it, learning how these characters were in the past. Apparently all 3 are old friends. And Senku seems to have a good family where his dad support's Senku's passion of science, and this person is now going to save the world. Also the anime is great at showing you how Senku is a man of logic but he's also \"human\". That's what makes him a winner. At the beginning you assume everything is logic for him but as each episode passes, you learn that's not always the case. He would never trade any of his friends for any secret he holds. And he'd let himself die with honor to science rather than logically saving his life. I'm totally rooting for Senku to wreck Tsukasa.\n","643: \t LMAO! The fact that even the tough as nails Handler fell for Anya's antics....I can't XD Also, idk why, but I laughed real good when that one bark was the only sound we got during the recap.\n","644: \t The real thing's gone now, but it's all there... In people's hearts. It's obviously fucking cheesy but I really liked that line. ಥ﹏ಥ\n","647: \t The ending with Annie reminded me of the season 1 Mikasa: “What’s the point of living anymore”\n","648: \t Seeing that white smoke was a real shock I did not think that there were others groups of people around. Nice to see Senkuu get to be as smart as he is and how he achieved his dream.\n","650: \t Poor Kokuyo. He was so certain that Kohaku would go against using the shield and she just instantly agrees and breaks his heart\n","653: \t Wow, what an episode. The eerie calmness with which the drama is unfolding with the rumbling in the background is absolutely mental. Armin's breakdown just put the whole chaos in context. I can't wait to see where this goes. Definitely one of the best episodes for me for how strange and chaotic it made me feel.\n","655: \t Gen imitating Lilian’s voice reminded me of that one scene in Grand Blue Dreaming when Kouhei was imitating different girls lol\n","659: \t In my opinion the most underrated part of this episode were the sibling’s voices overlapping when they were talking about killing everyone. Fucking chills\n","660: \t \"He Varrick'd himself because some girl Zhu Li'd him!\" Ooooh Varrick.\n","662: \t Stitches! Tsukasa Senku Kohaku vs Homura was pretty awesome. I especially love the when Kohaku was going in with the reverse blade strike from behind the trees. I just wished Senku prepared some eye protection for Kohaku too if he knew he was going to blind Homura with his flare. Then again we wouldn't have gotten this shot of Kohaku in background floating down the bushes. And it really didn't take long for Homura to remember that Senku is basically a vegetable and break free of his hold. Homura is a much more effective scout than I thought. I thought she just had the athletic ability to let her watch over everyone from the trees but apparently she had the awareness to monitor everyone to the point that she knows everyone's names and what their roles are in the village. While she may be smart and fast but with the intel advantage Senku and the gang has and Gen's sleight of hand they were able to fool Homura And capture her alive and unharmed. Maybe a bruised butt from that landing. Gen, Chrome, and Magma finally delivered the phone! Ngl though, it was fucking hilarious to see Taijuu's veiny muscular arm just punch through the ground like that! And finally after so many episodes of not hearing from them we finally get to watch Senku, Taijuu, and Yuzu speak again after they parted ways. Excited to see all the juicy intel we'll get about the Tsukasa Empire next week!\n","663: \t When those two Kuvira soldiers got knocked unconscious and were leaning on eachother it reminded me of that Mako and Korra scene in Book 1\n","664: \t Loid shouldn't have spent all the budget on the castle party, now he has to overwork to make up for budget cuts.\n","669: \t I can’t wait to see how cotton candy pays off with Hyoga, I’m guessing something goes down with that. Correct me if i got the name wrong\n","672: \t Lottie's death stare when franky threatened him almost killed me.\n","673: \t LETS GO!!! RUMBING IS HERE. It's nice to see Founder Ymir history. Ymir did indeed improve Eldian empire but also slaughtered Marleyans. That hate has been there for 2000 years. I kinda see Erens point. All that history is irrelevant to present day else if this was IRL there be would be no Germans/Japanese for what they did in WW2. In present day almost every nation seeks to destroy the island and every Eldians. Would you stand by as the world wants to see you destroyed for something that before you were even born? I hope not. Eren basically pressed that big nuke button while other nations don't have this big nuke button. I hope the end goal is to kill everyone outside the walls and then wipe every Eldians memory. Like Thanos said, shred the universe to the last atom... And create a new one teaming of life that knows not what it lost but only what is was given. Born out of blood but they won't be alive to tell it when their memory is wiped.\n","674: \t just to clarify, can someone please explain the ending where after grisha hugs zeke, and he tells him to stop eren? it pans to a darkened shot of eren standing in the distance then to a frame of eren from what i believe was from season 3 after he had his revelation from kissing historia’s hand. was the entire episode of memories from the future basically what eren saw after kissing historia’s hand?\n","678: \t Flameo! (instant noodles)\n","679: \t Oh, so that's why Suika was wearing that thing on her head? I wonder at what point will Senku become aware that Kinro also needs a pair of glasses. It comes to no surprise that the highly skill crafter literally looks like a dwarf.\n","681: \t Senku out here trimming weapons for free without scamming passwords. Best boy.\n","683: \t I literally got chills the entire episode. Didn't expect MAPPA to be so visual with the gore. I think the best moments ( and most disturbing ) were when Ymir was being devoured by her own children and when Eren convinced Ymir to activate the Rumbling. Seeing everyone's face when Eren talked to them through paths left me speechless, especially seeing Annie's father on his knees as well as the rest of the Survey Corp. Also, can't believe that Zeke was telling the truth and that he did have control of the founder's power. I thought for sure he was lying.\n","686: \t The fact Yor was pondering on how to be more motherly already makes what she thinks is a \"fake family\" already a legitimate one. Also how angrily she corrected Anya's kidnappers who kept calling her a maid. Truly heartwarming stuff.\n","689: \t Im curious now as to why Ukyo didn’t rat out Chrome. This will be an interesting season to say the least.\n","690: \t Suika being able to see is just so heartwarming!\n","691: \t Never in all my years of anime would I have thought a fucking telescope would have me feeling some type of way.\n","696: \t I wonder why Eren didn't just eat Reiner when he was down, it would have been a win-win getting rid of his biggest threat as well as gaining new powers. Oh well\n","698: \t If Amon is an Energy Bender does it mean he is secretly a bender? Like a combination of Voldemort(Destroy all the things that I secretly am) and Adolph Hitler( Use charisma and such to make mindless people do as I say)?\n","700: \t Is no one gonna mention the fact that while Tsukasa is making his name as the strongest primate, Homura flipping around doing gymnastics, Senku/Taiju/Yuzu being high schoolers, etc., Ukyo was literally a sonar technician in the SDF navy. His understanding of the modern world has to be closer to a modern adult's perspective (contrary to Tsukasa's more immature approach). If we go by the assumption that Ukyo has had more experience in the old world including acknowledgment of the objective benefits of science, then we can foreshadow that he offers a lot more to the Kingdom of Science than just his supersonic hearing, since he likely has other experiences that no normal kid would have experienced in the modern world. He could provide input that Senku and Gen might not have been able to come up with on their own given the relatively normal lives they had contrary to his.\n","703: \t Something I found extremely interesting and well written is the history of Ymir. I feel bad for her and I absolutely HATE the OG King of Eldia. So now we encounter a dilemma...I want that King to suffer and it feels like the right thing to end Eldians forever, aka the euthanization. But at the same time, they are all Ymirs children, and for example the people living now have nothing to do with the King except being his descendants. I want that Kings kingdom to fall, but the people who live now have nothing to do with it. They deserve to live, at least not die for something they didn't do! I just feel so bad for Ymir...and Eren is so fucking cool. Fucking broke his hands off!!!! But damn he reeeeally gonna kill everything outside the island now? DAmn. And that thing that attached to Ymir!!! It's like, it wasn't the source of living matter or a devil, just something random. And Ymir was both a great Godess who built roads and so on, but also the murderer. She was everything the stories told about her. But she wasn't free. The rumbling begins, Eren telepathically declares annihilation...This is insane. I can't believe it\n","704: \t I like the twist showing Varrick's more competent/darker side but I still think it would be a shame to see him turn into a mustachio twirling villain. Also, does anyone else find it weird that General Iroh is under the authority of Republic City while he sits so high in the Fire Nation's line of succession? Or did I miss something about him being the youngest of a dozen siblings or something.\n","706: \t I absolutely love how the blade of science wasn't the katana, but a tiny knife. It was the climax of the episode.\n","708: \t OMG this was beautiful. They've set up a whole year of them being stoic and unaffectionate all for this moment. I wept at the cake scene.\n","710: \t Great episode. Love Yuzuhira finally joining the Senku science squad and while she doesn't make a big impression personality wise, I still love her of being confused and how she will still help him. It's really funny (plus her face during it is hilarious).Overall, the face expressions are always top-tier hilarious. Especially Senku's reaction to Taiju revealing about the revival fluid. Also, Tsukasa just comes across as fucking terrifying. From the fact that he killed people (they are stone figures) and just the agility on the man is insane. I love how Taiju tries to say that killing people is bad but also shows his chest for some reason. I mean, I don't know if that helps your case much there man. Overall, a really good episode that show how dangerous Tsukasa is and while we don't get much of an impression of Yuzuhira, she can be pretty fun too.\n","711: \t As great as it was here, I do think that Kaseki's moment (when he was told he has friends) just worked even better in the manga IMO. Here I felt it was a bit too quickly moved on from, and of course the art can't live up to this\n","715: \t The science felt a bit iffy this episode, but the end results were awesome. Also that ref is a POS for allowing such bullshittery to happen, Magma just straight taking advantage of Kinro talking to the ref, and it’s okay. Probably my least favorite episode, though I still enjoyed it. Things like the ref and the fact Kohaku is dq’d five ft away from the ring just bother the crap out of me. Curious as to what Rui wanted to tell Senku, she probably saw him in a dream The new OP and ED are awesome, lots of good things to look forward to.\n","717: \t COMBUSTION BENDING CAN'T CURVE THAT WAY! THIS IS JFK ALL OVER AGAIN\n","720: \t Alrighty, now Senku has a waifu of his own\n","722: \t Just all of the pressure coming from every angle of this situation pushing poor Armin to a breaking point. Felt bad for him when he had his little breakdown as well as Mikasa with that quiet ‘Sorry’ for setting him off. Erwin really did make it look so easy even though he was dealing with his own pressure\n","723: \t This was a rough episode after that beautiful two-parter we had a couple of weeks back. It's hard to come back and care about the Varrick, nuktuk, and asami side stories when harmonic convergence and the end of times is right around the corner. How does all the Varrick stuff even matter right now? If he succeeds, republic city goes to war, frees the south, and he makes some money. Well maybe, the relative strengths of the northern and republic city militaries are not clearly established. But at the very least he would put some weapons in the hands of the southern water tribe and give them the means to fight back. Him succeeding might actually solve the whole harmonic convergence thing. He fails, nothing happens. Nothing about that matters or seems important. Mako got arrested? It's not gonna matter if the world gets wrecked in the next couple of weeks. That honestly is my biggest problem with Legend of Korra. The writers seem to have a lot of difficulty creating significance in their narrative. I remember in the season finale of season 1, there was a whole mess of stuff that was completely irrelevant. Who cares that Iroh showed up with the navy, all the boats got wrecked. Who cares that they destroyed the airfield, the other part of the navy was far enough away that they wouldn't have made it in time to make a difference anyways. Who cares that Mako was a dick to Asami? All that resulted from that was a couple of harsh looks and a lot of sighing. The villain was defeated by...what? Him stupidly using water bending and his face paint falling off? You would think if his entire plan revolved around the people seeing him as not a bender he would have a bit more restraint. In the finale of TLA, everything mattered. If Sokka and co didn't take out the fleet, they could have caused untold havoc/given support to Ozai. If Zuko didn't defeat Azula in the agni kai and gain control of the fire nation, the attack on the earth kingdom would have just been another invasion in the hundred year war and it would have continued. Even going further into the little details, If Mai had no sided with Zuko, and Ty Lee had not sided with Mai, Azula would not have gone crazy and would have had plenty of backup to deal with Zuko and Katara. Freeing the earth kingdom was also important to prevent the fire nation army from attempting any sort of follow up once they realized the air raid had failed. Everything mattered and fit together quite perfectly, truly a masterfully created storyline. Seems like TLA did \"big picture\" a lot better while TLK just kinda wings it from episode to episode while trying to stick to an overlying plot. I'm really hoping they don't just make Unalaq into a generic hungry for power bad guy. Honestly, what I'm hoping for is for him to end up being the actual good guy of the season. Bear with me for a second. So Vaatu and Raava fight every ten thousand years. Whoever wins, at the end of the ten thousand years the loser emerges from the winners body and...well I'm not sure, they fight again? Kinda vague on the details. So maybe Unalaq is worried that Vaatu is going to emerge within Korra, and, thus having the avatar at his side, easily defeat Raava. But then again, maybe that wouldn't happen at all, the mechanics of the situation are not that clearly explained. So maybe Unalaq wants to bring Korra into the spirit world in order to somehow prevent this or have it work out differently. Then again, Vaatu wants the spirit portals opened so It seems like Unalaq is just gonna be generic. Oh well. Also, I realize this may be an unpopular post seeing as how this sub loves to love TLK, so let me add a disclaimer. I do like this series, I think it has many positives and obviously I watch it pretty close to right after it airs (by going to some pretty crappy streaming sites I might add, rough life). However, I feel like the positives are touted and doted upon enough in this sub, so I like to provide a bit of an alternate perspective. If you disagree, please don't just leave a downvote. Comment telling me why! I'm very curious to hear other perspectives.\n","735: \t Jayce ate out Mel while Viktor bled out to near death. Caitlyn went to a brothel and then masqueraded as a sex worker with a woman.\n","736: \t I loved this episode. I was constantly worried throughout the whole thing, because Eren was in a bad situation already, and then Pieck fires a fucking cannon at his head. Although, I’m excited to see what they do to counter this. On an unrelated note, I really want to see Annie do something this season.\n","737: \t also: i really feel the gravity of Falco just putting it all out there since he knows his future is uncertain. He’s been robbed of his choice on when/how to tell Gabi how he feels, so now or never.. and lastly, remember S4E1? He woke up confused, thinking about flying around as a scout.. makes me think of memory transfer = he likely becomes a titan shifter. Perhaps that time is approaching? We probably have to talk about this on this weeks podcast.. so many feels!!!\n","740: \t Haven't been this excited since order 66! But why isn't it ending yet? Are they going to try to stop him? I really hope not. The rumbling makes so much sense for him. He grew up thinking humanity was wiped out beyond the walls and he joined the military to protect his people and kill the titans so they could be free. Then he finds out the whole world exists and everyone just hates them and sends the titans on purpose to eat them. It makes sense he wouldn't give a crap about any of them. His vision has always been freedom for the island. Where is Leviiiiii? How many episodes do I have to ask Connie has no chill lol understandable though Still don't like Gabi but it's nice she's getting some development I guess Annie is back? Who cares. Besides Armin? What can she possibly do\n","749: \t Goddamn, after all that happened, this episode made me nostalgic for season 1. The pure dread of the scouts looks, it seems like yesterday when Armin was sitting helpless and unable to move seeing the titans. Made me remember why I fell in love with this series. Also, that scene with the blouse family brought a tear to my eye. I'm all for the Gabi redemption arc lol. Morally complex characters runs in the Braus family it seems. PS: Rip Pixis, hope you're up there with some nice female Titan.\n","751: \t Seeing Suika cry after seeing the sunflowers for the fist time hit me like a truck. It made me realize how we see technology as something so monotuous, when it's because of this so now mudance sciecne that we can enjoy life at it's best. &#x200B; On the ending: Senku probably wants the silver because it's one of the best natural substances for killing bacteria.\n","753: \t AWESOME episode, far and away better than the previous ones IMO, and one of my all-time favorites from LoK. I loved the \"mover\" scenes, and the plot with Mako setting up the sting operation and getting double-crossed was great, especially the fight scene. I also really liked the way Mako found out about Varrick. Also, the good ol' memory loss plot. I have high hopes for the rest of the season!\n","756: \t Korra can't go into avatar state, and Aang's only defense against blood bending was the avatar state, which made him completely immune. Is Amon... Korra's avatar state in another vessel?! Would also explain how he is able to remove people's bending.\n","758: \t Mah boi Gen got focken stabbed!\n","761: \t Ehh not too big on this episode if im honest, some pros and some cons. Pros: 1) Onyankopon's speech was amazing and completely correct 2) I loved Jean referencing Marco again after all this time, and not going for the comfy life 3) I liked Armin's suicide plan, I actually thought he knew that Connie would save him and let go of Falco, and took that risk. Connie's dumb plan of cleaning his mom's teeth was hilarious too 4) Levi and Hange of course. Levi especially who doesnt seem too messed up besides the face and hand, Im not ready if we've seen the last of Levi fighting 5) I did like how all of the characters are now coming together, really shows we're nearing the end Cons: 1) It just felt rushed. Everyone was separated at the beginning of the episode and by the end everyone is coming together after some plan. I get the goal is having the characters come together but this was way too quick 2) The Annie pie scene was just weird, I like how they just ran into each other but not how the scene was meant to be humorous. And then we just skipped over and Annie was like \"ok going with them now bye Hitch\". 3) Wasnt too big of a fan with the Mikasa and Louise scene. I get Mikasa doesnt really like her but shes on her death bed, really? I get it maybe shows Mikasa moving away from Eren but i still think she still clings to him 4) Colts death was sad af and I was excited to see Falco's reaction, but besides a second of crying I guess we just move on 5) While I like the endgame, I am annoyed how so many potential character interactions were just sped through to get to the characters meeting up. How do people feel about Annie? Or Reiner having ptsd from Mikasa and Levi? Or Armin even talking to Annie? How do people feel about Levi being injured? About joining Magath who is fine with killing them and is still a complete Marleyan? Im sure next episode will answer some things (like what does \"save the world\" mean to the characters, because i get they have realized genocide is wrong but do they plan on killing Eren?). Overall not the worst episode because I see where the story is going, but just feels like we went from A-->B way too quick and with little regard for the characters and how they view the situation\n","762: \t No way the Chief of police and Tenzin would confront Sato based off a PHONE CALL.\n","763: \t This show just gets more and more intense every week, I literally love it so much. Eren is so badass and this is all gonna come crashing down. The VA when he was in their heads was fucking insane with the OST in the background, literally gave me chills\n","764: \t Last week, we had Handler berating the terrorists for spouting shit about war as if they understand from the perspective of someone who has clearly seen what horrors it truly entails. In this episode, she mentions how she used to have a daughter like Anya. It looks like WISE agents are probably war veterans who understand how bad things can get. After all, Loid's goal is to ensure no child ever has to go through such things again. It's not yet explored, but it seems that all Loid, Yor, Anya, and Bond all have hard pasts as well. It's nice that they're pacing the harsher stuff here and there. It's a great balance. A seriously amazing series.\n","766: \t So... who was the guy that helped Caitlynn and Vi? He seem so ashamed of himself im just curious who he is. Im just can seem to figure it out..\n","768: \t Remember when they were just trying to get to Eren's basement with a key... turns out he was the key all along.\n","773: \t I just...holy shit that weapon. How many people were possibly killed in this one episode by it? I'm really curious to see if anyone from team avatar is going to be dead or severely injured by it. Not to mention there are still civilians being evacuated from the city that are at risk from it. Also, looks like colossus IS a giant mech. Not to say I'm disappointed( because that thing looks pretty fucking awesome), but was anyone else expecting something a little more...conventional? I figure it might've been a giant airship that had spirit lasers attached to it and spirit nukes ready to bomb the city if necessary. I don't know, I guess a giant mech is much more of a threat, but I can't help but feel we might be going a bit over the top here\n","774: \t I got so excited when Shimazaki start to slap Teruki's face in different places while doing teleportation, I laughed so weirdly from excitation. Every single frame in this episode is beyond amazing.\n","777: \t Well, Senku could have taken a page from Ginro's playbook, and as a leader, have both Kohaku and Ruri into his harem.\n","787: \t Somebody has to tell me the music that plays during the whole Jean And Floch fake execution fuckin, 5d chess move from Jean scene, it was so badass!\n","789: \t Btw was the girl in Jean's dream (?) at the very start Mikasa? Looked a bit like her\n","790: \t Alright, in I go. Penultimate episode of the show technically, assuming there's a movie instead of a \"Season 4 Part 3.\" \"So much for stealth!\" - Barney Calhoun Annie is doing her Annie thing, as Annie does. Honestly I kinda missed her signature carnage. Jesus, if the engineers need half a day, and Eren's already reached Marley, that's gonna be a hell of a lot of destruction before they can get anywhere near him. Also weird seeing Magath in a Survey Corps coat. The stupid flying boat is starting to sound like a lot more trouble than it's worth. If it's just about getting close to Eren, I'm pretty sure Falco or Annie could carry people in in a tenth of the time. Second to last time for this intro. It'll be a bittersweet farewell next week, I think it's been my fourth-favorite (which is REALLY high praise for AoT) Jesus, if Magath in the Wings of Freedom is trippy, compare Mikasa and the Female Titan working together. Floch is surrounded by several of the most dangerous people in Paradis, all his enemies, can he PHUCKING DIE NOW!? And once again, Reiner gets to act as the Shield. Annie: (fighting) Female Titan theme: (I sleep) Pieck: (appears) Female Titan theme: (REAL SHIT!?) Alright, I guess Falco's gonna fight. Really hoping he gets to be not-a-liability. Oh shit, Annie is FUCKED RIGHT UP. Reiner too, but that's normal at this point Oh my god Connie is unleashing all of his torque The animation this episode is legit, they really pulled out all the stops Lol Pieck literally did Gorosaurus' thing from Destroy all Monsters OH MY GOD FALCO'S JAW LOOKS FUCKING METAL AS SHIT, but also kinda like Xavier Renegade Angel BIIIIIIIIIIRD Ashes on the Falco Okay for as much as I'm rooting for his demise I gotta admit Floch cut a pretty good jig there what grape juice why Mickey is a fucking BUTCHER, I'm gonna need to watch that three more times I'm still a little vague on why Floch's thunder spear made a wine explosion. Feel like I missed something there. Not feeling great about General Magath's odds there. FUCK YEAH SHADIS! Explains who blew the train. God damn. This would actually be a good end for these two. Rest well, old soldiers. Looks like something after the credits too, one sec Damn, that is rough for Annie. The staggering amount of pain she's gone through in her life all for one thing that's probably as good as dead now. Unless maybe the Liberian Eldians got out? They did know the Rumbling was coming, so I suppose it's possible they could have led a revolt and flown the coop with Marley's military in such a sad state. Just one more fight, Annie. Really liked her trying to reconcile with Mikasa. So I guess next week is the technical series finale, before the assumed movie. Feels surreal to think this is coming to an end. Attack on Titan is a large part of what got me into anime, and it's become probably my favorite work of fiction.\n","792: \t Couple questions: If Eren is in control of the titans now, why are the smaller titans still attacking subjects of ymir? It's implied that Eren can choose which memories to send to Grisha, but wouldn't that mean that both the past and future/present are happening simultaneously? My mind is barely holding all this together lol\n","794: \t I think yelena had the most beautiful shot of the episode when the blimps go down and the best face of the season 😂\n","797: \t If felt that one,when he checked his \"friendbook\" for birthday wishes,also this episode highlights that he doesn't have any friends apart from clients and mob,whom he really just views as people who are related to his trade. Can't wait for more shishou-disciple development in the later episodes.\n","802: \t I can't believe Senku and Chrome are blind now...\n","803: \t Great episode, but need clarification on something; isn't Homura one of the people revived by Tsukasa? If so, shouldn't she have knowledge of the \"old world\" and know what cotton candy is? Or did she know what it was and was just worried Senku and co. were trying to kill her through poisoning?\n","805: \t Am I the only one that thinks Tsukasa foreseeing Senku's steam engine is some pretty big plot convenience?? Like he's smart, but predicting a stream engine attack is a pretty big stretch imo\n","806: \t The gang being on a train gave me crazy jojo vibes. I don't know why.\n","809: \t Zhu Li. Wow. Whole new side of her? Was she just acting to help bring down Kuvira? What's going to happen to Bolin?\n","810: \t Forger family is always ready for wardrobe changes , they should be models ! Yor again showing off that killer instinct ( and legs ) , Anya being wholesome pie damn it got me emotional when she talked about her family ... When she said i have to go school or we wont be together \" mine ( and Loyds ) heart broke :(( Truly an elegant episode gonna be hard to wait for week to resolve this cliffhanger !\n","811: \t I get it, I get it now. So this is what they mean when talking about waifus. I finally found it, my waifu. Look a that figure, just look at that raw power, that passion, that wit to realize it couldn't possibly be true that her idol was just a the other side of the phone, her sentiment, her understanding of the Kingdom of Science being the best thing for humanity now. But most importantly... LOOK AT THAT SMILE! I will fightfor that smile or face my thalassophobia for that smile. I'm so glad Nikki is joining Senku.\n","812: \t Gen obtained Cola Ruri became healthy 😭😭😭 Senku gained the title of Chief😭😭😭\n","821: \t That lightning scene. Wouldn't the bar of iron be extremely hot for senku to just run up and grab it? Also i forget the name but standing near a lightning strike can still get you affected by it even if it doesn't directly touch you, so in theory everyone there would end up with some burns or scars\n","830: \t Shiney Monkey Strong! Aw they added Tarzan to the childhood montage. George is pissed... Wow thats a huge rock... Its good to see Moe-chan also helping fight back. Tarzan doesnt really expect anything of her, shes like a dark horse. So Senku has a plan huh? Lets see what it is. Damn George doesnt want to loose Senku... thats real friendship... Senku had petrafication on his neck this whole time? Thats one hell of a long con. We get to see when Senku woke up? Neat. Talking monkeys? What? ahahhaha So Senku knew he needed his friends to get by from the start huh? Thats neat. I love this montage with monkey commentary, this is amazing. Man they end us there but that was great to see how he got started. He had a lot of ingenuity and dedication to survive out here. Thsoe monkeys never stood a chance.\n","835: \t Man it was great to see Taiju again. Also I’m shocked that Kohaku could keep up with a professional gymnast that’s super impressive\n","836: \t I’m not being funny or anything, but out of all the people they could have revived Taiju had to bring back his waifu first... Yuzuriha better contribute more than being moral support/MC’s love interest or I’m going to be disappointed\n","841: \t \"You... you hit me! N-not even my own father hit me!\" - Damian, probably. And so debuts the most iconic face of Anya, you'll see it in keychains, t-shirts and various merch everywhere from now on. Hell, I'd expect it on her future nendoroid as a unique face that you can slap on other nendoroid figures. After the previous episode of Loid and Yor turning red so many times, we know have Loid and Yor turning blue at the end. First Tonitrus getto daze~!(Anya's now ready for early game Bloodborne).\n","842: \t The end was heart warming. Senku was so relieved\n","843: \t Viktor's transformation and the Vi / Jayce team up... chef's kiss I'm also loving the subtlety of Caitlyn and Vi's relationship progressing from platonic to romantic. You can tell it was written with care ✨\n","845: \t I'm so stoked to see how Su's assassination plays out. Something is going to go really wrong.\n","846: \t I love how Senku is still excited about little \"unimportant\" things like making cotton candy or celebrating Christmas. Despite his rough exterior and how much he talks about what is \"logical\", he has a wonderful lack of cynicism that I find refreshing.\n","847: \t I think people may be missing the political side of the revelation. How many non benders in the city will start to seriously consider Amon and the Equalists instead of dismissing them as crazy shadowy group when they find out he has severely weakened many(or all?) of the criminal gangs. Or he could try to take over the criminal underworld now without much resistance. There is a lot of power that way too(see Italy/Mafia for real world comparison).\n","848: \t Now that Eren has gone off the deep end. Gabi feels more and more like the protagonist. She even had the Eren hairdo and was badass. I just need Falco to be okay.\n","849: \t but toph being able to see everything in the swamp gfgjfd\n","852: \t Wait, Unalaq is the chief of the Southern water tribe as well? If they are governed by the same ruler, why would they have needed 2 positions in the Republic City council?\n","857: \t Tsukasa thinks he’s doing those children a favor by smashing their parents. What does he think their reaction will be when they wake up holding their fathers decapitated hand?\n","859: \t I don’t know why zeke appearing and telling eren that his big brother is here now to take care of things made me emotional\n","860: \t Korra as a fighter is just SO hard to watch this season. I'm assuming that she's going to kick ass in the end, but this was really too much. Obviously, that was the point, but still... I would have enjoyed if Korra's pants didn't keep figuratively falling down.\n","865: \t Damn, took 9 minutes to get to the OP with great timing. Senku wakes up and it's very much an 'ohayo'.\n","866: \t This was so good! The family trying to become more refined by having an outing. Only to be foiled as all of them lack in bits and pieces of common sense. The action scene at the end was good, and seeing that animated ending for the first time was really a joy. Loved it!\n","868: \t I can't believe Emiya, dressed as Lancer, kidnapped the Prime Minister. These Fate spinoffs are getting weird.\n","870: \t Wow that's insane they resorted to killing their own people but it was expected since they teamed up with Marley. Only Connie killed them but it looks like the other 3 will have to kill to escape. Hope the animation is rewlly good next episode since there's intense fighting. Also I wonder how Annie will do against Thunder Spears since she crystalized before they were used. As always Annie is good at killing people on ODM gear. I want to see the rumbling so bad now that they hit the mainland. I have a feeling they might censor it cause their literally stepping on people like ants. I understand the Yeagerist their doing it for their country any person would do it for their country also especially against Marley who killed many people on the Island. With the founding Titan power to wipe memories Eren could kill everyone outside the walls then wipe the memories of every eldian assuming only eldians live after destroying the world. It's honestly not a bad plan, Thanos was about to do this too cause as long as people remember they will rebel against it. There's not much episodes left so I really hope they release the movie at the same time for both Japan and USA if their doing a movie and not another Part.\n","871: \t i like how scientific the show is but ginro saving chrome is a little far fetched... ginro showed up out if no where as chrome was falling. also, the spear should have snapped and ginro shouldn’t have been able to support chrome from that angle...\n","875: \t Took 2 months to finish making light bulbs even with the necessary knowledge. Each milestone really just makes you appreciate modern life more and more.\n","877: \t When ymir found the power, why didn’t she go to kill everyone, including the king. Why go back to be a slave with so much power?\n","883: \t Freakin loved this episode. Senku is awesome. Senku truly is MVPOE: Most Valuable Person on Earth He's literally advancing this village in technology faster than anyone in history with his huge knowledge of science. Watching it unfold is so rewarding. Seeing the Mentalist happy makes me happy. I think he knows he chose the right side. Tsukasa is all about power and new world order but he seems heavily short sighted in his long term goal. Senku has everything you need that it makes Tsukasa look like the biggest fool on Earth. The Mentalist grabbing Senku to have him watch the New Year's sunrise with the village was pretty damn adorable I have to say. He's grown on me so much. I was really touched when Senku made the Christmas tree right on time for Christmas day. It shows really how awesome Senku is as a person. He didn't need to but he did it and even those who don't know of that tradition were moved by it. Senku acts like a \"100% rational science addict\" but deep down he's a kind and emotional person that cares for others. Senku also doesn't get down in the dumps when he fails, he always keeps going in a positive manner. After all, science is born upon failure. When he thought things weren't working out with cell phones, he was ready to focus on a new goal - he's really an incredible role model. Go team Senku! Shout out to Gramps for being amazing 24/7 (Also the nice little touches make this show even better like the video game character selection screen)\n","885: \t At first, I didn't think this was that good of an episode. Korra fought equalists, Asami was being a bitch, blah blah blah boooring. There was even a cliche \"the baby is coming!\" moment. But when that fucking ending happened. When Iroh showed up... I was left speechless, with my jaw dropped and everything.\n","887: \t Loid's about to make his minister some kind of old badass doing a solo op and taking out an attempt on his own life, complete with acrobatics.\n","890: \t Korra's flashback...was Aang trying to reach her from the Spirit World. It makes sense! Her biggest weakness is her inability to connect with her spiritual side. As she's knocked out by Amon, Aang manages to send her images that are directly relevant to her situation, be it the Yakon guy or whatever. Somehow it all relates to Amon, and Aang would be able to guide Korra if she could communicate with him.\n","892: \t I love the scene where Loid mentioned he stopped smoking because of his daughter. See you in October Forgers!\n","895: \t Varrick is evil. WHHHYYYY?!?!? Makosami is back online. Bolin is a jerk. Korra is on the crescent-shaped island full of the fire sages, and was likely brought there by the moon and ocean spirits, judging by the last bit with the waves.\n","896: \t Korra is just not having it with Wu's antics and I love it!\n","901: \t FINALLY we get some backstory on Kuivra. FINALLY. And that was a good cliffhanger to end on, but Varrick, as always, steals the show.\n","903: \t The contrast of Tanjiro just chilling doing chores to Zenitsu and Inosuke in mortal danger was pretty funny. Overall another good episode, and make sure to watch the post-credits scene if you haven't.\n","904: \t omg this episode!! It felt so awesome to see Zeke throwing rock but to the enemies this time! Too bad he got knocked out already omg these episodes really do feel like just 5 minute :(\n","905: \t And they never knew that Keith was the one who saved them\n","912: \t I fell like Senku put that bit of stone behind his head since he would’ve been smart enough to know he still has it from his constant head cracking or if like he after tries to connect the stone fragments he was petrified in. ALSO in the shots we are given when looking behind his head (such as when he wakes up) there isn’t any stone left on it.\n","914: \t Salt bae appears again, no matter what I will always find that funny. But what awful luck they all have with having that guy fighting Kinro first. Luckily he got Suika's glasses now, and yeah I know that that's probably not the correct prescription for him, but will still work fine, he can worry about the headache later.\n","916: \t that was a hype fight! was surprised gen came back to help. seems like we're gonna learn more about senku's dad based on the ending.\n","919: \t Did he just make carbon fiber wtf.\n","924: \t Zaheer is sort of right in a few ways. For example the Republic City's president is a fool and the Earth Queen is basically a crazed tyrant. Maybe you don't have to kill them, but maybe they shouldn't be the leaders. I'm thinking the Red Lotus is going to end up overthrowing or actually killing the Earth Queen, which would be totally understandable. What if Ghazan teaches Bolin lava-bending? What if P'Li helps Mako with some fire-bending techniques? I think they'll try getting them on their side.\n","927: \t So that waterbending ice drill was pretty cool.\n","931: \t Anya is a treasure. Had me dying when she couldn't read the clock\n","934: \t KAMEN RIDER KINRO Gosh I love that build up to this even though it was so cheesy and just all for a pair of glasses. Also anyone else thought of something worse than piss when they mentioned ammonia?\n","937: \t Funny how eren was willing to die in uprising in chains after seeing memories of Grisha killing the Reiss family, while his future self told Grisha to do it while in chains\n","938: \t Why does Tsukasa even keep Taiju and Yuzuriha around? Now he knows Senku's alive they're obviously spies. Even before he knew, he had to have been incredibly suspicious of them and if he lets them know anything about his battle plans he's a downright fucking moron.\n","940: \t The main hashira guy... Can nezuko heal him? And is that seriously it? We have to wait a year or so for more episodes?\n","941: \t So Loid and Yor start at the handholding stage. LOL The scenes after the ED song shows what'll happen next: Yuri will stop the kiss. Damn Yuri. LOL Yuri's affection toward his sister is pretty normal, a bit excessive but not much different from a father toward a daughter. It's like how a father would react when he heard his daughter got married in secret. The thing I hate about Yuri is that, for all his intelligence, he works for a fascist organization. Guess he's not that smart. And he got drunk so easily. Uncovering Loid's lie can be easy: he claims he's a psychiatrist, so, quiz him on Psychiatry knowledge!\n","942: \t quote of the episode.. “what’s so wrong with submission?” i have a few major questions after seeing all this.. - Do we believe Floch? Did Eren really keep him in the loop and not his friends? And if so, is it just because he knows he can use Floch as a tool? - Will Conny really go through with this? This plot line feels so random, but I guess it’s a showcase of how desperate people can be pushed beyond their limits. - When on earth are we going to see Eren again!? Can’t wait to chat about this one on the podcast!\n","946: \t Jinx/Ekko fight was real good... but I feel like Vi let her sister down again when she really didn't need to. Ekko wanted to present the stone to Jayce and should have been the one to leave with Caitlyn instead. Vi should have stayed behind to reason with her sister. Vi started off being my favorite character... now I just don't know about her. At this point I can't blame Jinx for being the way she is. She needed guidance and unfortunately Silco was the only one to provide that even though he's in the wrong.\n","947: \t I feel like Mako and Asami should have lost the fight. They were fighting a waterbender in the ocean. The waterbender (forgot his name) could have just done the Katara-freezing-Azula move and freeze the boat in its place.\n","949: \t At first I was skeptical that neither of the two royal inheritors of the Founding Titan after the walls came up had the will to rip themselves out of their chains like Eren, but then I remembered that they had the memories of the first king within the walls, which contained memories of the Great Titan War; it must surely have been a horrible war to keep the inheritors in their chains. I suppose they were also chained around their neck, unlike Eren. I love this show's theme of our ancestors' memories controlling us, removing our freedom. Shifters like the royal Founding Titans, and Eren's speech to Armin about Bertholdt's memories removing his free will, and even normal Eldians and even Marleyans, their hatred for each other sourced from millennia of ancestral memories, passed on without the whole cannibalism thing. It's just like with the destructive power of Titans, sure any Eldian could be turned into a ruthless entity whose goal is to kill humans, but the same could be said of Marleyans, or even us in the real world. We all hold within us the capacity to commit atrocities, and that capacity is often unlocked by the shackles of history. And so Eren thinks he is acting of his own free will; he didn't cause the Rumbling because his dad wanted, not because or Kruger, not because of some ethnic hatred sourced thousands of years ago. No, he sentenced the world to die because of the present, because the world wants to kill Eldians now, not a hundred years ago, not two thousand years ago, now. The present situation is because of history, but there's nothing to be done about that now, it's too late. He cares about himself, and because of that he cares about his friends, his people, not what happened hundreds of years ago. But in ignoring history, Eren has been set up to repeat it. Just because the rest of the world is gone, that does not mean there will be no suffering, that doesn't even mean Paradis will be safe. As we saw in the first three seasons, humanity within the walls was not at peace, suffering still abounded. Ymir did not suffer because of the existence of Marleyans, Middle Easterners, or even Eldians; she suffered because she was born into this world. But yet, stopping people from being born would not solve suffering either; not in the least. If you're trying to clean your room, you don't accomplish that by removing your room. Suffering is solved by attempting to minimize it while also coming to terms with the fact that it must happen. That's not to say that people suffering is okay or should be ignored, but that living in this world inextricably goes hand in hand with suffering. I'm also so curious as to what they're going to do with Annie, and what they're gonna do about that whole Asian country thing; I suppose they won't much like being stomped on by giant Titans.\n","950: \t I had to watch it twice to recollect my thoughts. I wrote last week that the last episode was one of the top 5 but this one today, HOLY SHIT! From the beginning I though it strange as if Grisha was really seeing Eren and Zeke? When we Grisha said that the Attack Titan can see the future does that mean that he actually saw them but thought he's dreaming as he said so? THIS PART MESSED ME UP REALLY GOOD.Grisha was saving lives ever since he became a doctor, it never occurred to me to question the fact that he almost killed the whole royal family besides Rod.SO IT WAS EREN WHO FORCED HIM TO DO IT?????? Why was he screaming to the sky and asked if Eren is happy?How is Eren any different from the other inheritors of the Attack Titan?Because he was born free? Also why did he say \"Why won't you show me everything?\" Does Eren really have the power to show him a fragment of the future? I almost teared up when Grisha hugged Zeke and said to him that he loved him. But how did he see him all of a sudden? Or was he seeing them throught the whole episode? Someone wrote that today's episode would be peak fiction and I couldn't agree more.I have no words to describe how I feel right now. This is the greatest piece of fiction I have ever seen and I'm so happy that we're witnessing it in our lifetime. That's all from me, stay safe and see you all next week! Thank you Isayama. (OC)\n","955: \t Let me just say the animation was insane. This takes nothing away from ufotable. This episode had a lot of classic shounen tropes that I dislike. Fake \"deaths\" for shock: Uzui is dead. No wait, some ex machina happened. Inoutske is dead. Oh no wait, some ex machina happened. Zenitsu is almost dead. Nope. He's actually more powerful now???? Even Uzui was more powerful suddenly. Tanjirou, the protagonist summons insane power randomly. Maybe this is explained in the future but rn, Tanjirou was suddenly holding his own against an upper six when Uzui has had to save him twice before. Before Tanjirou couldn't even react to Gyutaro's movement. And finally at the end, he summons 1000x power when he's at weakest. Okay I guess. Villains talking and giving heros a chance to recover and fight back. Do I need to say anymore? Classic shounen. There's such sudden power shifts in the fight randomly. One minute the demons are so OP you feel hopeless. Your heroes are dead or almost dead. But the next moment, the heroes come back stronger and suddenly the demons don't seem as powerful? Idk. Again, I may be heavily downvoted but I felt betrayed by the last episode. None of the what happens in the previous episode mattered. Uzui wasn't dead. He came back more powerful. Inoutske is the worst offender. I knew they would do some bs and not kill him and that's exactly what happened. Just for the sake of shock, they \"killed him\". I was really excited for today's episode. Racking my brain for how they would win. Maybe nezuko is needed again? Maybe some other Hashira makes an appearance? Nope. Everyone just came back from death to be more powerful in classic shounen fashion. Oh well\n","966: \t Loid: Figure out Yuri's true profession from just a brief conversation and a bit of background check. Also Loid \"My wife could totally learn how to take down a cow from the Yoga class. Nothing is weird to see here.\" Does Yor have a passive that lower everyone's suspicion/IQ level? lol\n","967: \t There is something special about seeing Dimple help Banshomaru, plump body and all, flying around the forest while fighting The Dragger. That Achilles tear is gonna sting though, just ask any athlete who suffered that injury ever\n","968: \t Dash Granny should join the Body Improvement Club, she'd fit right in. The Dragger fight was pretty awesome. Dude just straight up snapped his Achilles. Hang in there Mob~\n","970: \t Well well so Yo was not a corrupt police officer, he was just incompetent, impulsive, but at least had justice on his hearth. I like this version of Yo more, he is still a simpleminded dumbass, and a bit of a scumbag tho.\n","971: \t Korra: You are the worst police chief ever! Tenzin: You really are the worst police chief! Ever!\n","973: \t Am I the only one who seriously thought they killed Kai until the end there? Also, this is my favorite episode of season 3, just all round awesome. 100% badass. (Except for one little part, when Asami says that she'll guard Korra while she meditates her voice goes really strange for a second. Don't know what happened there.)\n","975: \t \"Maybe I can reason with her.\" ... \"Please take your army and leave.\" Some great diplomacy there, avatar.\n","976: \t Damn, Tsukasa is not only physically OP but also smart af .-. And Taiju is gonna give me a heart attack handling the statues like they can not break!!!\n","979: \t What a chad the President was this week. He might have taken the L for the stargazing segment but that was only due to his wrongheaded pride, he had Kaguya on the ropes the entire episode. I also love how we've gotten greater developments in their relationship in last episode and this, - seriously how is it not obvious to them (and everyone else) that they are desperately into each other already?\n","980: \t Something I haven't seen mentioned while skimming the comments is that Tenzin's self-sacrifice is made all the more awe-inspiring when you realize he knows he's screwed from the get-go. He's fully aware that to capture the Red Lotus last time, it took Zuko, Tonraq, Sokka, and himself to subdue them. Now put in the same situation with no back-up, he doesn't even hesitate to take them all on at once, just to give his family a chance to escape. They should start calling Tenzin the North Wind, because he is a beast.\n","984: \t As much as I wanted to see Mob rampage at ???% I'm happy to see Dimple calming him down. He's such a bro!\n","985: \t At least Toph didn't die.\n","986: \t Absolutely loved the scenes with Armin, Connie, and the two Yeagerists. The tension when they're pretending to be on the same side was insane, and the moment Connie decides to kill them made my jaw drop. Imagine being told back in season 1 that we'd be cheering for the Armor and Female Titans vs a bunch of scouts.\n","987: \t Korra was about to crush Kuvira with a fucking boulder omg. And for a second I thought we were going to see Meelo kick some ass.\n","990: \t Another badass Yor moment as she sorted those bullies out 10/10\n","992: \t Yor: I hope you've learned your lesson, Mr. kidnapper. My sister in christ, he's dead. You turned him into a pinball...\n","993: \t It's really sad now knowing Senku will never see his dad again. The ED is so much more heartfelt now\n","995: \t Neat that they kicked things off with the ending scene of the first season, although the story they kicked off with is less focused on our two romantic goofballs and on Best Girl Hayasaka. Hayasaka in a catsuit! I love how we never find out what Kaguya's plan was for knocking Shirogane out. She just ends up with his face on her shoulder and gets stuck there in pure bliss for hours on end. They trimmed the chapter down a tad, like there was a lot more Fujiwara and Hayasaka, but it was still pretty entertaining watching Hayasaka maneuver through all these different characters to leave Kaguya and Shirogane alone. Poor Ishigami though. Kashiwagi's boyfriend has entered his popular phase now that he's got a committed girlfriend and their relationship is sailing smooth. So much so that they might have gone all the way. Not that they'll tell you or the student council that. The Happy Life Game was happy for everybody but Kaguya and Shirogane. Ishigami died but he at least got to appreciate all the game mechanics Fujiwara wasn't responsible for (and then gave her some helpful tips at the end), while Kaguya ends up rich, alone, and married to Fujiawara as an old lady while Shirogane ends up divorced and crushed under child support. Let this be a lesson kids, don't have too many babies and don't marry Fujiwara. I love how Kaguya and Shirogane are so extra in their attempts at getting close to one another that they can create such complicated misunderstandings that can somehow still make each other happy even when they're completely and utterly wrong. Props to Konomi Kohara. I never would have realized that was Fujiwara reading off the fortunes until they showed it was her. The new Opening may not be as iconic as the first, but it's definitely very much a strong successor in it's own right. Showing off the cast in some very in-character scenes, showing off the new characters, and just the kind of fun hijinks that everyone gets involved in. Overall, a good Opening, and I'm excited to see the Ending next.\n","998: \t Ok first F you Nick for having your video player be run by gerbils. This was a good episode it was great to see Korra reunite with Mako and Asami. I figured Korra sending a letter only to Asami would lead to some backlash I am just glad it didn't take up the whole episode. Good to see the comedic duo of Varrick and Bolin is still going strong. Holy shit I guess we can call Kuvira Bendist now seeing as she only wants Earth benders in the Earth Empire god she is scary. Prince Wu is always good to laugh at and it was funny to see him be rejected by Korra. Ok so Kuvira and Battar Jr. think it is a good idea to rob the spirit vines of Tophs swamp. I expect a major loss of Kuvira's solders by the end of the next episode. So now I have to wait for not only next weeks episode but Smash WiiU as well. Oh the wait is going to kill me.\n","1003: \t What an amazing art. Taiju waited more than ten million of hours to confess, so I thought that he will confess right away. Well, being rejected after all that time is truly terrifying. Good luck, big oaf.\n","1008: \t Akari Kitou finally got a script longer than the back of a napkin, I wondered whether she would be able to speak in her demonic state, something like \"die!\". I love her fire blood technique. I'm also happy to learn about Daki's other half. Last episode I complained about how neither Tanjiro nor Nezuko, not even with their power-ups, should be able to stand against the upper six, so I'm happy to learn that Daki herself is not that strong. Seems Shigaraki from MHA got tired of waiting for the new season and decided to jump to another show.\n","1009: \t Old lady spy getting all existential on us in this season finale. Thank you narrator-san for narrating the entire series and main characters to us in the show we've been watching already. WISE has been running Loid so hard on other missions that he hasn't had a lot of time to spend as the man of the Forger Family, to the point where he now has a new enemy...gossipy housewives. And you really don't want to mess with them. So the best way to improve his families image and his as a father is a family outing! Sure, Loid is barely able to stand, but all for the sake of Operation Strix. Figures the one time he has a good excuse to get out of another mission, it turns out the place he's going to with his family is where his other mission is anyways. And of course he also runs into more gossipy housewives. Anya being so overjoyed and happy at an aquarium is so infectious. Loid is so good even at playing a rookie penguin handler that he ended up getting the guy he's playing promoted to chief. I don't foresee that ending well. When Loid isn't sure he can properly complete his mission, he can always rely on his family to back him up! Whether it be his esper daughter helping him locate the penguin he needs or his daughter and wife taking care of the terrorist he was after. \"Wow\" indeed. Anya playing spy with her stuffed animals and eating peanuts has got to be the most Anya thing ever. As well as being savage with Yors' inability to do anything that doesn't involve killing or beating people up. Yeah, figures they wouldn't want Anya to go into their rooms where they have deadly weapons stored...but being so forceful about it makes poor Anya cry. But the perfect way for a family to come together is to play along with her and her stuffed animals and games and turn it into a family affair! Even outside where everyone can see them! And yet the smile on Anya's face is worth every minute.\n","1013: \t \"For the sake of my mission, I absolutely need her school life to be smooth sailing.\" Reaaaallllllyyy Loid? Are you ABSOLUTELY sure that its JUST for the sake of your mission? Are you sure you aren't just a protective father?\n","1016: \t Aside from comic relief and giving the episode a more human touch, what was the point of including Pai Sho? In the context of Zaheer's anarchist speech the rulebook's excerpts about each culture having their own rules, no one necessarily better than the other, seemed like a commentary on the different forms of government. While Ozai's reign was definitely a bad thing, a more benevolent tyrant could be the best thing for society since sliced bread. Similarly you could elect a good president or a bad one. It's a nice counter to Zaheer's whole \"government is bad\" routine, the idea that varying forms of government make for a richer world.\n","1019: \t I'm so happy we got to meet some of the side characters! Also, Hayasaka watching stampeding elephants before going to sleep. Gonna try that later.\n","1020: \t My thoughts: WHO WAS YAKON, and when do we get a series about Aang fighting him? Korra's reaction to Amon's broadcast was a great moment, and the \"overcoming your fears\" storyline was pretty good. Bolin gives Korra a plastic bag, which confirms there are plastics. Are they bendable? Someone here mentioned the possibility of Amon having a plastic mech or vehicle... Jinora and Ikki's pai sho game was a nice background detail. And Tenzin's kids continue to provide effective comic relief. Korra says, \"[Mako] hasn't mentioned you at all,\" but have Mako and Korra even seen each other since he met Asami? Moments like this--and Tenzin not having a chance to talk about the duel with Korra until she's already in the boat--make the story feel a little rushed. Lin Bei Fong shows up at a party in Korra's honor just to take her down a peg. Hilarious! The whole chi-blocker training camp raid scene was great. I'm suspicious of Asami's \"I feel so safe with you\" line. Seems like a Joss Whedon technique: make things seem really good between two characters so that you feel worse when something bad happens. Also a con-artist technique: to gain someone's trust, first get him to believe you trust him. Is she going to betray him? For you Makorra shippers: Mako's scarf is all he has left of his dad, and he doesn't feel safe without it, but he let Korra borrow it last week. Aww... What's Hiroshi Sato's deal? Seems like he's meant to be an important part of the story. Just making him a Fire Ferrets sponsor doesn't add up. If Amon is working on a big machine, Hiroshi could be helping him. Willingly or unwillingly? This seems a little too much like The Mechanist, though, so maybe not. I love that when Amon says, \"I assure you, I have a plan,\" I believe him. That's one of the benefits of creating a show with a planned, fixed-length story: moments like this don't feel like BS. Unlike \"and they have a plan\" in the Battlestar Galactica opening, for instance. Nice to get a glimpse of Sokka, Toph, and Aang in Korra's vision. Who's the mysterious man? Yakon? Is there any connection between Yakon and Amon? I enjoyed it. I'm glad we're starting to go beyond what was revealed in press releases before the show started. And a lot of the scenes that appeared in the season preview have already happened, earlier than I expected. We're only a third of the way through the season!\n","1023: \t When Shadis told the recruits to join the Jeagerists and wait until the right time to revolt I think he was thinking back to Erwin’s coup.\n","1025: \t Damn, I sure did not expect Yor to be able to kick out a car. I like how they ended up meeting together at the same time. I wasn't expecting to see Sylvia meeting the rest of the family. Lol, I love Loid's and Silvia's reactions when Anya said this. So Anya was able took keep the dog because she reminded Silvia of her late daughter. It is so nice to see the scene shown in the vision happen. I love how full of herself Anya is because she got a dog. So thanks to what happened during their visit to the dog park, Anya ended up naming her dog Bond. Aww, they look so sweet. Oh, so next week's episode will involve that woman that really hates Yor.\n","1026: \t I like the the marriage dog collar\n","1028: \t Fujiwaras crying scene was so good, the animation was so smooth and really wants to make you cry too as if you taught him\n","1030: \t I don't get why Hayasaka used \"conceptual ambiguity\" on Shirogane. Didn't she know that a girl that allows a guy to let her be a side piece screams desperation and is a very slimy deal considering that Shirogane's a hard working guy with high moral standards. It seems that she just used a canned strategy that could work on a playboy or a desperate virgin and didn't know her target that well. Kinda disappointed. EDIT: I just noticed, what kind of ice doesn't melt after three hours in room temperature??!!\n","1033: \t SATO FRAMING HIS COMPETITION HOLY CRAP. Justice for cabbage corp!\n","1035: \t For those who wonder why Ginro might risk his life in the next episode, take a look at the main properties of silver and what it reacts to... You just might understand what Senku wants to find next.\n","1037: \t Surely the Anti-Titan Rifle won't come into play, amiright guys....right\n","1039: \t Korra whispers \"Aang?\" when Tenzins running towards her.\n","1041: \t Toph is so wise. I love how she knew about all of Korra's enemies (even the names) while being in the swamp the whole time. :)\n","1042: \t Yor after kicking a guy, \"I'm sorry! I'm an amateur, yet I just treated a patient\"\n","1044: \t Tungsten, also a great material for making weapons to fight Diclonius. But to do that, We Require More Minerals. Mecha-Senku exposition powers Go! Senku is right, that worst case scenario would've been bad... That shpeal about finding the precious treasure of friendship.... Yeah, save the sap for when Senku brings back pancakes there guy. As soon as it showed what Gen whispered to Magma it all clicked that it was gonna be his birthday. And what a present they gave him. I mean just look at Senku's face, during that presentation looks like his heart just cracked in half with emotions. Even if he plays it off with his practicality.\n","1046: \t To the people complaining that Korra is pathetic for losing to Kuvira, remember she's still rusty, and she can't beat the main antagonist yet until we get closer to the finale.\n","1047: \t Yor you suck Yuri: this bitch... You should divorce Yuri: could this woman be one of my people? TIL: there is food made using a cactus. I'm glad Monica turned Franky down because holy shit dude is a stalker. Creepy af.\n","1048: \t I love the scene on how Ikki made friends with the bad guys just like how Bolin made friends with the Red Lotus!\n","1049: \t Great episode. So nice to have Yuzuriha and Taiju back. Ironic that the plan falling apart actually resulted in a more desirable outcome. Now they have an ally who knows what's really going on. It will be interesting to see what happens next and if they're able to trick the rest of them or get them on board in different ways as well.\n","1051: \t Wait.. How come Senku never thought that Tungsten didn't exist at that age?\n","1052: \t I felt guilty for Loid as he doubted Yor.\n","1054: \t Gabj literally had a “Hair Up, Square Up” start to her redemption arc lol\n","1055: \t The Forger Family will be getting a DOG! (Of course not naming the dog, spoilers) That action scene when Anya dove into the pool, A++\n","1059: \t I think this is the episode which finally hammered in how scared this show/story is to show violence. That and the animation (or lack of it) of Homura dodging, weird sense of positioning. A really poor episode.\n","1062: \t Holy crap they invented electricity already. That escalated quickly.\n","1063: \t \"Chrome, you're a genius! A sweaty, stinky genius!\"\n","1066: \t Mako's face when Bolin compared Kuvira to Korra...I couldn't help cackling out loud.\n","1067: \t SKY BISON FAMILY! OMG so adorable!\n","1068: \t Damn this episode really spiked the quality of the show. Can't believe i was so happy when Senku was happily mentioning rock names that are completely unknown to me.\n","1073: \t When Iino became frightened on the stage and couldn’t speak a word, the audience seemed to drift away from her; this is EXACTLY what people with stage fright would experience. And when she conquered her fears, the audience drifted back in front of her. These tiny subtle details are what I liked the anime adaption so much. They really poured their heart and soul into some minor components of the show that not everyone will realize. A bow to the production team.\n","1074: \t Small-ish question, what would you call the type of jacket that Vi steals from that guy.\n","1075: \t Damn... That's heavy... It reminded me of personhood theory, do spirits have the same value as humans? That's something only someone like Mob could answer fully... And it's great to see the growth of Mob, I'm loving this season\n","1077: \t Eren the edge lord. Could literally swim underground and go fking green lantern but chooses to be a meat bag instead.\n","1078: \t Anybody knows why Yelena gave that look to armin?\n","1081: \t Once again, I am giving a big fucking \"WHY????\" to all the folks who are still on team Eren at this point. If the implications of genocide aren't enough, this episode spells out his hypocrisy and, frankly, idiocy. He has the founder and the power to change the pure titans back--Gabi reveals that he took away Reiner's hardening, so he has the power. --yet he ignored them and the damage they could have caused because he's too interested in pursuing vengeful violence. His goal is to protect his people yet he leaves them to die. His rumbling destroyed all the protective walls. The titans would have had free reign all the way to Sina!! What if the scouts had failed. After his rampage is done, he could potentially have come back to all of paradis being eaten. Also, BARRICADES!!!!!!!!!!!! Edit: I misunderstood the hardening situation. I forgot that the walls are made from hardening. To start the rumbling, I guess he removed the hardening--rather than just having the colossal titans move and break free (which, is what the animation made it look like.) So, when Eren commands all the \"hardening\" to disappear, it not only broke the walls but also the hardening on Reiner's titan and crystal around Annie. BUT, regardless, this still proves that Eren has overwhelming control over titans and still left the titans in Shiganshina where he knew people were.\n","1084: \t lol the divorce bit was funny. tbh more like senku is so funny. cmon ruri who eats medicine like that 🤔 when she started choking up i thought it was because she had a sulfa allergy perhaps. but wow it worked out in the end that's great. now time for some juicy backstory next week please\n","1090: \t No way Levi is dead.

This season won't be as fun as originally expected, but at least we'll get Money Wars: Kambe Daisuke vs Shinomiya Group\n","107: \t I am just so happy my man Senku is back And best girl Kohaku\n","134: \t I really don't understand the cause-effect chain that led to this moment. Why did Annie, Reiner and Bertolt attack in the first place? Because Marley needed the founding titan to increase their military power? I mean yeah Eldians first committed atrocities to the Marleyans, but then the Eldians took an oath of nonviolence and withdrew to the island, so you think that would be enough for them. \"Island devils\". What Island Devils take a 300 year pacifism vow? So why did the Marleyans attack the island?\n","153: \t A good 'ol song from the dead. I thought this show was only 'watchable' in the first half as well as the tournament arc, but this second half with building the phone was actually really cool. This series is really great with its problem solving, especially with how well it keeps you engaged with how well-explained everything is. This upcoming battle with Tsukasa seems very action-heavy, so I hope there will be a good blend of that problem-solving mixed in.\n","180: \t I guess Armin was wrong about Eren all along. I'm biased because I love his character too much, but damn it if Erwin was saved instead. Armin convinced everyone to help Eren, and he wouldn't have been able to pull it off without them. I guess he had to be killed off for the story to progress.\n","217: \t Finally mako! Got some balls bro!\n","219: \t So it seems like the next episodes will finally be the clash between the two empires? Super curious to see that one. The OP kinda spoils a bit already, as we can see a few of them with Katanas, but I wonder how far they could've gotten, after the age of swords. I wonder if he was able to at least build one of those super old rifles where you have to reload each shot. That would already be a game changer\n","237: \t It's crazy that a big part of the fan-base are unable to recognize their own relationship to Eren and the setting is the same as Armin's. Armin's familiarity with Eren make him emotionally bonded and hopeful despite Eren's obvious descent. The repeating ethical question and problem posed by AOT is 'ends justifying the means' Characters endeavour to do great and ruthless things throughout the shows-run, some of them excuse their actions in big ways, others in small ways -- but the big lesson is that a route of evil is always wrong no matter where it leads, and no matter who takes the path as we see explored with Gabi. We don't need to know the future to know Eren is deeply evil, you can see it by the time Eren kills a person. Eren values his tribe over others and tramples on their humanity -- he is as cruel as anyone on the show. Armin wants so badly to see his friend redeemed, to see the ends justified that he turns a blind eye to current events and current action, hoping for a future that excuses and absolves their crimes. Armin believes in atonement, and paradoxically this belief is one of the beliefs that facilitates some of the horrors that happen in the show. Eren's horrific version of self-interest and tribalism is another.\n","249: \t Tanjiro is such a good girl and very attentive lol\n","260: \t I haven’t been keeping up with the latest episodes and I haven’t read the manga but from what I have seen online there’s something that’s been bothering me. If Grisha was refraining to kill the Reiss family until Eren finally got him to kill and take the founding titan and then give it to little Eren how would Eren have ended up with the ability to go back and convince Grisha to do all of this? If Grisha never took the founding titan without Eren’s meddling how would it have ended up in erens position to do it to begin with?\n","286: \t i know its the show's maintheme. but the way anya readied her throw with that drum intro made me think You Say Run was about to play\n","305: \t Can the shifters still transform? Isn’t Ymir done building Titan bodies? Technically they shouldn’t be able to transform right?\n","324: \t Lin in her usual perfect sass form! So excited for her to be back!\n","333: \t Awesome show. But have they addressed the issue of language drift (can you understand Middle English?) and gene pool (can a group of six people create a viable group of healthy offspring)? And assuming they can, the village seems to have few dozen people, the number seems rather small. Also still waiting for info on how they crossed the ocean (the astronauts landed in South America, didn't they? So they had to cross the Pacific..).\n","341: \t Lillian had the cake, the dump truck, the fatty, the batty, the money maker, the donk, the trunk, the business class\n","403: \t \"you need to act more like a girl, Historia. Now, blow.\" LMAO\n","408: \t What is up with that traffic light Yor stopped at that shows green to orthogonal directions at the end of the episode? What was the intention there?\n","411: \t Anya: Is this the end of the world?! Anya having her own waku waku in her dreams. Always the waku waku. Well, considering her past, its understandable.\n","417: \t Yor panic stutter as a follow up joke had me dead on the floor. I laughed way too hard watching this episode. It felt like a rapid fire of constant jokes that somehow kept landing one after another. It was a pretty enjoyable experience. Probably my favorite episode.\n","418: \t Just because Tsukasa keeps his society pure doesn't mean others won't wake up with the ability to recreate society and its weapons. Senku is only special due to the speed he's doing it and his close proximity. Japan, especially is one of the most notorious examples of superior weapons being used against them to force compliance.\n","466: \t Is anyone else getting massive Code Geass vibes?? It seems Eren is uniting the world against himself specifically. Then the Eldians (esp. Mikasa and Armin) will kill him and \"redeem themselves as heroes\" to the world. I think it also makes it a lot more clear why he's isolated himself so much from them and tried to antagonize them. Also, I think \"knowing the future in detail\" has made Eren a slave to it, and this must bother him greatly (independently of how bothered he is by his \"forced\" actions themselves). I really wonder if he'll be able to break free of that chain (I'm not sure if death will count...).\n","536: \t This action doesn't prove anything, I still hate Gabbi for killing Sasha. Great episode btw, so far, every end of the episode anticipates for the next one.\n","566: \t Translating \"biscuit\" as \"cookie\" How dare you, this is an outrage\n","586: \t GREATEST FUCKING EARTHBENDER OF ALL TIME\n","617: \t A bit late, but I have to say that this is an experience the whole way through. Being able to see the end of what is often tagged as \"a modern epic (for damn good reason, mind you)\" is nothing short of incredible. The OP has quickly grown on me, with the climax of it (and the shot of Eren looking into the distance being morphed into his child self) being one of the most emotionally-charged sequences of any form of media. Same with the climax of the ending. The intro scene with Zeke, with the vintage AoT music style (distortion, suspense, \"classical\" instruments), is one of the best scenes in the whole show, I think. I will very likely cry when the show ends. Hell, I'm tearing up right now just thinking of it. I also want to make a story that can rival this one someday, but that is such a heavy burden.\n","620: \t I gotta admit, Anya riding around on the dog is pretty damn adorable lol.\n","622: \t Ok seriously what is wrong with new generation bender. Why do they insist in fight in close quarter with this chi-blocker people. It dont make any sense at all? I mean if i'm a earth bender. I would surround myself with tons of dirt and see if they can touch me. Waterbender use ice to tank them hit? Firebender you got no excuse here, you can surround with fire they wont be able to touch you. At least you firebending like azula to put range between you and them. It like they become dumber all the sudden. Seriously bender you got range use them.\n","632: \t Why did Zeke not instantly trigger the sterilization of the Eldian people, given his intentions? He displayed some nice tactics in seasons 2 and 3, but I’m not so sure about his overall strategy. He could even have joined forces with Mahr; they probably planned on an Eldian genocide anyway, once titans were technologically surpassed. Instead he killed a lot of them and they incapacitated him. It feels like he still needs his brother’s validation before tolerating it as morally acceptable.\n","649: \t how does Floch go from being a coward in battle to one of a scheming leader? That's a 180 degree change! Also, Eren's life mission went from killing all titans to killing every human on earth except those on the island...\n","652: \t It seems highly unlikely that Toph would destroy Kuvira's army seeing as that would prematurely end the series. I think Toph will beat Kuvira in a fight, but Kuvira will use Suyin as trump to get Toph to back down. Toph will probably then allow herself to get captured (like Bumi in TLA) so that she can rescue her family. I strongly suspect we may see Toph bend Platinum too.\n","656: \t Remember in season two when Eren called Reiner and Bertolt traitors and rightfully so? Good times.\n","657: \t The Jeagerists got their arms training from the Grand Army of the Republic\n","714: \t Two things I loved this season: Animation as always Our boys' resolves. When Zenitsu held Daki's hand, it seemed as if he will fight her alone even if she's an upper moon. And similar scenes were shown for Tanjiro multiple times.\n","718: \t My sister and I were waiting for our big dog, and we finally got him. My sister was way more excited than I was.\n","721: \t Chrome saying 'science users' like it's some martial arts is hilarious.\n","726: \t \"I am not in danger, Skyl- I mean Zeke. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets brainwashed and you think that of me? No. I am the one who brainwashes!\" -Erin\n","732: \t My favourite part of dr stone is where it gives you some very specific instructions on how to build something dangerous, and then tells you not to do it. Like that’s gonna stop meme\n","743: \t On a side note, some knowledgeable person can enlighten us if that's actually the most efficient way of getting antibiotics? I'm no chemist, but isn't getting moldy bread(or was it broth) easier than all of that process? I know it wouldn't be as entertaining to watch 3 episodes of mold growing, but still I'd like to know.\n","771: \t man varrick's storyline with mako is so booooooooooring\n","772: \t Am I alone in thinking that I don't want Erin to be the final bad guy? I mean listen, He watched all this bullshit, all of them did, since they were children. Then you find out how incredibly terrible the Marleys treat the island kin. I mean straight genocide, slavery, oppression. Now Erin wants to kill everyone not from the island. I mean, I don't want to be the guy that says Thanos wasn't wrong here but is Erin really a bad guy?\n","818: \t Hold up, where does the \"Ymir split her soul into the 9 titans\" thing fit into all this? I remember this being exposition in the previous season\n","825: \t I was surprised last week when this turned into a three episode arc. I forgot that this is the second part of a long first season, so three episodes isn't a big chunk of that. I do wonder about the planned timeframe of Operation Strix. How urgent is it that Twilight meets with Desmond when they need to wait for Anya to become an Imperial Scholar. The script writers are great as they put the phrase Anya Park into the dialogue as I thought of it. If the dog wasn't telepathic, he probably would have gotten used to Anya calling him Mister Dog.\n","828: \t Want Levi and scouts to kill hundreds of Wall Collossal Titans with ODM. Imagining it gives me chills. It will be a sight to see. But not sure whether the Wall Titans has the stream powers as Armin. And Eren is not making sense. Genocide is not a solution. This is not our Eren. But lowkey hoping, he will stop killing spree after rumbling Marley.\n","856: \t Chrome really went \"That's my purse, i don't know you!\"\n","876: \t This show always makes me want ramen. Also Senku reminds me of people in tech companies trying to push for new tech they want to play with. \"we need phones to beat tsukasa. Yes I know guns would help too, but phones are more important. Goddamn it I just want to have a phone again!\"\n","911: \t I would be very happy if I could die by Yor's legs\n","923: \t Anime only, here's how I would have preferred this to go after thinking about it for a few hours Annie is riding south from Stohess Trost. Connie is riding Northwest to Ragako. While they were doing the final titan hunt, a chunk of them broke away from the fort and started moving inland since there are no walls anymore. This gives Armin a double reason to follow Connie: Get Falco back, and kill the Titans, since he can do it safely in his colossal form. He has a dilemma to go after the Titans or Connie, and he chooses Connie first. Connie doesn't rest in the woods. He arrives at Ragako and camps there while he has a Walter White vs Krazy 8 situation, agonizing over whether he can pull this off. I like this better, because Gabi and Armin don't heroically ride in conveniently at the last second, they have time to catch up because he's wrestling with himself over whether he can do it. After that situation is resolved, they start riding back and see some lightning off in the distance, and ride towards it. Annie had transformed to defend Hitch from the rogue titans, killing them, and it's a very tense moment because Connie is extremely worked up already, but Armin negotiates the situation for now and they ride back to Shiganshina. Mikasa would probably be super angry at Annie still and have unsettled scores. I know there's a lot of show left to explore these things, but I don't think anyone would disagree that this episode could have been handled better\n","959: \t okay this is easily my favourite episode of this show. the animation! the music! how hilariously dramatic everything was! bill and his entire existence lmao. i could not stop smiling throughout.\n","981: \t Interesting thought here. Remember when Eren was first discovered to be a titan, and Shadis almost killed him with a cannon? In that moment Eren somehow had a flashback to Grisha right before he gets eaten, telling him to harness the power he is given. I wonder if Eren sent this memory to himself at the time, as he was then able to save himself from the cannon. If so, Isayama is a god for this level of detail.\n","982: \t My egg bending has progressed to flipping slightly mangled eggs. Woo!\n","988: \t Kaguya's shocked shriek at the beginning of the episode... Bless Koga Aoi.\n","1029: \t So was Mob exorcising all the evil spirits and then turning into ???% what leads to the very start of the first season where we see ???% exorcising spirits?\n","1031: \t the sister complaining about ugly people all the time? it seems like her brother would have been ugly in human life as well as demon life...\n","1058: \t I think the one who killed Mei's brother is Darious\n","1069: \t \"There's a disturbance in the force.\" - Master Jinora\n","1101: \t I am so taken a back by the ne Episode AGAIN. Every fucking week Isayama manages to make me question, everything that ever happened in this show. : Be it the flip flopping between hating and loving Zeke, between rooting for and fearing Eren. Be it my thought and theories about the truth and history of the world being supported and then completely thrown. Be it the twisting of my hope for our beloved characters well deserved happy end into despair at their untimely demises (Rip. Pixis and Niles <3) Or be it by simply pulling on all of my heartstrings with the incredibly well crafted and super emotionally loaded Scenes unraveling before my Eyes. (That Hug man, That fucking Hug) No matter how this journey ends, I'm so glad I got to be a part of it all. Thank you Isayama, Thank you Mappa, Thank you Sawano and Yamamoto, Thank you all for giving us this unforgettable experience!\n","mean: 267.3666666666667, median: 155.5, std:

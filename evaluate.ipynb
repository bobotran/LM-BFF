Mappa really sucks at making their flashbacks smooth. They seem so awkward and obstructing.\n","\n","\n","\n","Second, I am getting tired of mappa's exaggerated facial expressions using lines around the eyes, it only worked once and worked perfectly on Ymir and since then it has felt overused.\n","26: \t The animation and music this episode, holy shit MAPPA you killed it\n","28: \t Yeah it's safe to assume we'll get no explanation as to why everybody was just fine with annie showing up out of nowhere and tagging along them in the span of 2 minutes. Got used to better writing.\n","31: \t I was wondering when we were going to see the Azumabitos again. They showed up last cour, hit us with \"Mikasa is a royal heiress, also we have flying planes,\" and then just left without either of those things coming into play. I wonder if Mikasa's royal heritage will be relevant at all or if it really was just a pretense for Hizuru to get their hands on the island's resources. \n","\n","I'm now remembering that our other princess also has unfinished business.

It's actually believable now that it could be 2d\n","52: \t Animation was just not good today. Felt like it was done by Studio Pierrot or some low quality studio. Did not feel like MAPPA's work.

Armin's familiarity with Eren make him emotionally bonded and hopeful despite Eren's obvious descent.  \n","\n","The repeating ethical question and problem posed by AOT is 'ends justifying the means'  Characters endeavour to do great and ruthless things throughout the shows-run, some of them excuse their actions in big ways, others in small ways -- but the big lesson is that a route of evil is always wrong no matter where it leads, and no matter who takes the path as we see explored with Gabi.  \n","\n","We don't need to know the future to know Eren is deeply evil, you can see it by the time Eren kills a person.  Eren values his tribe over others and tramples on their humanity -- he is as cruel as anyone on the show.\n","\n","Armin wants so badly to see his friend redeemed, to see the ends justified that he turns a blind eye to current events and current action, hoping for a future that excuses and absolves their crimes.  Armin believes in atonement, and paradoxically this belief is one of the beliefs that facilitates some of the horrors that happen in the show.  Eren's horrific version of self-interest and tribalism is another.\n","113: \t Season 1 episode 1 title: To you, in 2000 years.\n","Season 4 episode 80 title: From you, in 2000 years ago.\n","115: \t I waited a whole week for a 20minute version of 7 psychopaths?!?\n","116: \t Not going to lie I felt the ending was a bit abrupt mainly because of the music but I felt it added to the themes yet another reason why attack on titan is so good any complaints I have have still have amazing importance\n","123: \t Jesus Christ is all I can say about the end.. a lot of the show has been pretty heavy but.. Jesus\n","126: \t AAAAAAAAAAA I CAN'T WAIT FOR ANOTHER WEEK\n","128: \t does anyone know what chapters were adapted in this latest episode?\n","129: \t Another week another episode with shoehorned interactions and dialogues worthy of a mediocre fanfic.\n","133: \t So Eren is Paul Atreides now\n","136: \t Holy shit that was such a fast episode\n","137: \t I just really hope it was not last positive plottwist of the series, and from now on, it just gets worse....\n","138: \t This episode was a trip… sheesh\n","140: \t ANKA’S DEAD 😭\n","\n","Was surprised when I realized there were actually other Anka fans.

Throughout most of Part 1 my opinion was that I really didn’t like the direction it was moving in and struggled to get through it honestly. The second part has me hooked all over again.\n","186: \t I know I should have read the manga, but I'm kind of glad I waited for the anime.  OMG WTF. ~~Agatha~~ Eren All Along?\n","189: \t I hate how they equate sterilization with euthanasia... As if preventing birth is the same as murder -_- by that logic every time you use a condom or birth control you're killing people. Why do they call it the \"euthanasia\" plan?\n","191: \t Holy fuck, what a great episode, love the animation (both 2d and cgi alike) and love the choice of soundtracks, it's episodes like these that make me wish i could time travel back to 8 months ago and tell myself to not read the manga after part 1 ends to watch this for the first time again\n","193: \t Wait, it's all Eren?

The first 5 minutes were literally repeated scenes from the last episode and some scenes felt like fillers like they were deliberately trying to stretch this episode out as far as possible without covering too many plot points.\n","205: \t So unless I'm mistaken, there should be around 11-12 chapters remaining to be adapted, yet seemingly we have four episodes left. Gonna be interesting how this plays out, and part of me is wondering about that potential movie idea people have now and again theorised. Or could it be possible the final or final two episodes could be longer? Like 40-60 minutes?\n","206: \t I had my jaw open for the first half of the episode until the information break, for the 2nd half i had my hands over my head.\n","207: \t GABI WAS SUCH A BADASS!!!!!!\n","210: \t POV Annie right now when all of this is happening: 😴😴😴💤🥱🥱😴\n","211: \t I binged watched most of season 4 part 1 and got to this episode now.

It's been over 15 minutes\n","284: \t Am I the only one who is on Eren's side? I genuinely think destroying the whole world is the only way to save Eldia since their sin is too big that everyone will hate them and fear them if Eren just destroyed Marley. Eventually, the world will unite against Eldia if Eren don't trample the whole world. Am I the crazy one to think like that, or is everyone against Eren and Eldia?\n","285: \t Question: what's up with Zeke? Where is he now? He was waiting in the paths waiting for Eren, but I don't remember learning what happened to him after Eren initiated the Rumbling.

This is probably the best episode of Attack on Titan I've seen.\n","\n","This is what Game of Thrones failed to do with Bran, but well executed here.\n","334: \t After this episode I'm sorta thinking that Falco is to Gabi what Sam was to Frodo, maybe toned back a little. Or maybe not, what the fuck do I know?\n","335: \t It was great. I can't believe we are witnessing an end of a modern classic masterpiece! I don't want to see Falco turning into titan. I enjoyed the whole series. Even being a weeb, this series is my favorite cause every episode is a banger and you always want to continue on. Final Season Part 1 was the Evolution but Final Season Part 2 is the Most Best Season of the anime history. The biggest negative I can find out is the fucking opening which is also great but I hate whenever they shout in the song otherwise the whole opening is great and if that's the biggest negative I can find out, this ain't bad!\n","341: \t balls\n","347: \t Wow Karl Frietz is truly a cuck.\n","356: \t Happy cake day SNKBot!!!\n","360: \t Last week, I peeked at the first panel for the manga chapter that this episode adapted, and saw it said Stohess District; but the anime showed it as Trost.\n","\n","So how did Hitch go from Trost to Stohess in presumably just a few hours? More importantly, why was she in Trost in the first place?\n","\n","I am confused.\n","361: \t I don’t know what to do with my hands.

The end credits for the episode was also amazing. I have to ask though, anyone know when the next episode will come out or is it just unknown?\n","394: \t People calling every episode a cliffhanger this season lol. It’s a continuous story that’s not going to wrap itself up neatly every 20ish mins, that doesn’t make every ep a cliffhanger.\n","396: \t You guys can’t imagine how much I miss Levi 🥺\n","400: \t MY MIND HAS JUST EXPLODED\n","401: \t these episodes are TOO DAMN SHORT are you kidding meeee someone please leak the rest\n","403: \t .....\n","407: \t Now THIS was the episode we needed\n","408: \t I guess Armin was wrong about Eren all along. \n","\n","I'm biased because I love his character too much, but damn it if Erwin was saved instead. Armin convinced everyone to help Eren, and he wouldn't have been able to pull it off without them. I guess he had to be killed off for the story to progress.\n","410: \t MAPPA did a phenomenal job to kick off Season 4 Part 2! CGI was very well done and all the still shots were great as well. The OST at the beginning with Zeke and the Jaegerists was eerie (in a good way).

What an absolute CHAD!!!\n","415: \t Is it just me or the cinematography of this episode was really impressive\n","420: \t Episode was ridiculously hard to watch. Not even going to speak for the awful recaps and pacing of these past like 4 eps but overall the show went kinda downhill for me after the rumbling started.\n","\n","Also yikes at the obvious plot armor. Made me sick to my stomach watching the alliance just breeze through every difficulty with next to no casualties after Connie and Armin got caught. The show used to do a terrific job of showing you the stakes and making you feel on edge but this episode reversed a lot of that just to give some artificial friction as a result. Would have just been happier if the show runners skipped the recap BS and the unnecessary Mikasa and Connie gore.\n","\n","I’m glad many Alliance fans are happy to see their “heroes” fighting for a world that hates them but for me I am just really not taking a piece of this shit cake. I don’t care who lives and dies at this point. If they decide to adapt the rest into a movie I think I’ll just read the manga and move on till it releases.\n","\n","Edit: Triggered AoT fans that take some kind of pleasure in downvoting opinions that aren’t “tHiS sHoW iS piEk FiCtIoN” are the best.\n","422: \t what website do u use to watch the episode?\n","424: \t That's some damn good CGI\n","426: \t How did the Wall titans cross the ocean?

Is everyone related to Ymir through some weird breeding system enforced by Fritz?\n","\n","Of course, if this goes into manga Relevants, I don’t wanna know.\n","294: \t How was Eren able to convince Grisha to go along with the plan if it was just a memory?\n","295: \t The kids eating there mums body is peak fucked up attack on titan\n","297: \t The first half of the episode:\n","\n","Eren Spamming “B” to skip dialogue and cutscenes to get to the cave scene.\n","298: \t that face Yelnas had what was that\n","301: \t THANK YOU FOR HANGE AND LEVI FINALLY\n","304: \t So what's the difference between Ymir's royal blood descendants and the subjects of Ymir?\n","306: \t Just curious does it make sense for falcos titan form to be a titan only because of his name\n","311: \t One thing that people are not realising is that Eren not only manipulated Grisha.   \n","He also manipulated Kruger, the Owl.  \n","Top fiction.\n","316: \t Wow...this has to be the biggest reveal to date.\n","\n","What blows me away is that even though we see Eren push Grisha to kill the royal family (which in itself is absolutely wild), but he HAD to do it for the Eldians to have any sort of resistance against Marley *because* Freida was unwilling to save the Eldians at all and just to let them die and fall to ruin.\n","\n","This *was* the only way for the Eldians to survive, which Eren wants, so it was necessary for him to force Grisha.\n","\n","It does of course have some time travel fuckery where the future  (that wouldn't exist if Grisha hadn't done what he did) is affecting the past. So it's definitely a kind of \"final destination\" scenario, which leads me to believe that Eren himself doesn't actually have control of what he does since he knows what actions he MUST create to keep his future vision intact (since he MUST do it).\n","\n","Absolutely wild and heart breaking for his character.\n","318: \t HOLY FUCKING SHIT THIS EPISODE GOES HARD\n","\n","WHAT KIND OF QUANTUM-QUAZI-MEETING DAD MOMENTS WERE THOSE\n","\n","I see Season 4 is heading for a 10/10 on IMDb huh\n","\n","Also, I didn't know the future memories thing was exclusive to the Attack Titan.

They're on a near-impossible mission, which if they pull off, will mean Eldia will likely be genocided anyway. They have no brains. Sure, everyone wishes the wars would stop.

It's also late to stop Eren who's already made it onto Marley.   \n","\n","\n","So what's left - why kill your fellow scouts for probably the dumbest hero mission I've seen in recent fiction history? Enough of this self-sacrifice that says Eldia should be the one to die, because genociding others is wrong.

Way back when Eren kissed Historia’s hand, did he see aaaaaall of this or only what his father did? Was that moment him knowing that will do for the entire story because he remembers himself doing it…in the future via his dad’s memory?\n","425: \t OKAY SO that fucked up scene of Fritz Feeding his children Ymirs corpse was fucked up but also looked weirdly familiar.

And Floch finally died. 10/10.\n","432: \t Really liked how they let onyaknapon have his anti fascist moment. It might’ve felt a little blunt but it definitely was nice to see him call out how the jaegerists have become even worse than Marley at this point\n","435: \t Boy am I glad they still had some tensions to settle with each other that didn't just disappear because of the ongoing armageddon, great episode\n","438: \t Fuck daddy issues traumatise that bitch back\n","441: \t Daaaaaaaaaamn, 3rd episode and so much has happened already. Plot twist on top of plot twist, wasn't really expecting Zeke to come up on top like that but I guess it makes some sense. Still I hope there's no way Zeke's plan is the one that's going to be successful in the end.\n","447: \t So everyone seems to be going nuts over how this title mirrors the 1st episode's title, but honestly I fail to see the significance. Anybody care to explain?\n","\n","I mean I get that \"From you, 2000 years ago\" obviously refers to how Eren saw Ymir's memories from her life, but the other way around in the 1st episode? Or is it something that will get explained even later?\n","448: \t \"Aren't we all friends?!\" - guy who just shot his friend\n","454: \t After every episode I like to go back and read the old chapter threads. And I have to say this chapter turned a genuinely disturbing number of people into absolute fucking psychos. I can see why this series has a reputation for a toxic fandom with people casually saying 'yeah genociding 3 billion people is actually good and Connie is just as bad because Samuel was his friend'. If Isayama was trying to tell a story about the inhumanly violent nature of humanity, he sure did a good job bringing it out of his fucking fans.\n","456: \t Yo Grisha referred to Mikasa as daughter……..HOLD THE FUCK UP\n","459: \t *Emotional unrest between all characters from both sides*\n","\n","Hange: (・_・)ノ plays chef\n","461: \t This show just gets more and more intense every week, I literally love it so much.

The VA when he was in their heads was fucking insane with the OST in the background, literally gave me chills\n","462: \t Hi guys, I’m a huge advocate of the show and I want people to understand how amazing this show is so it gets a little tricky but bare with me.  Long story short… the attack Titan can see the future but the user can’t send the future memories to himself.. only the predecessor. So future Eren sent his memories to grisha instead. When Eren kissed historias hand … he saw the future of what grisha saw.\n","464: \t Wait so if grisha kinda saw what eren would do in the future and asks zeke to stop him....why give eren the titan power in the first place? Am I missing something?\n","472: \t damn floch's a bitch fr, he obviously lied about knowing about eren's plans\n","474: \t For those who just can't understand how a smaller force beat a bigger force... read up on how wars are won.

I really was beginning to like Magath.\n","476: \t I loved this episode. I was constantly worried throughout the whole thing, because Eren was in a bad situation already, and then Pieck fires a fucking cannon at his head. Although, I’m excited to see what they do to counter this. On an unrelated note, I really want to see Annie do something this season.\n","484: \t I noticed that we lingered on a shot of Armin’s eyes (which were slightly heterochromatic) when he was making his big speech. Maybe I’m misremembering but when his speeches sound logical I feel like that’s him trying to manipulate. Is he actually on board with the euthenization plan? He also intentionally said Eren lied about Mikasa which could push her into helping. \n","\n","Armin is not the kind of character to be pushed around, I definitely feel like he has his own agenda, or is more of an active participant that his incarceration with the other cell mates would have you believe.\n","485: \t Annie-chan!!!!!\n","486: \t I love erens reaction to zeke\n","488: \t I’m annoyed to say that flocks death was sick\n","497: \t That has to be in the top 3 shortest AOT episodes. \n","\n","Man, the average Attack Titan lifes are fucking nerve-wracking. \n","\n","Nice to see Grisha referring to Mikasa as his daughter. \n","\n","Wow I am speechless, I have no idea where we are heading, even with no action scenes, this definitely is a 10/10 episode.\n","\n","Was Frieda and her family death censored or am I imagining things?\n","502: \t So what was that with the sun setting EAST? They're going North and the sun is on their right. If Falco really was locating himself by looking at the sun's position then he should have deduced that they were heading South? Or am I missing something?\n","504: \t This episode was honestly a weak one, but is definitely important for the narrative going forward, since it seems most of the major characters are going to try and stop Eren. I still find it incredibly convenient that everyone managed to link up and make a plan so quickly, but alright.\n","505: \t that's annie right from the last scene?\n","\n","man imagine annie waken up like she was in a different world\n","506: \t Zeke: Our father Brainwashed You- \n","\n","Eren: Well first of all i brainwashed him\n","\n","Zeke: -and im going to undo it\n","\n","Eren: secondly im going to undo yours lmao\n","515: \t This was an absolutely incredible episode. Some (nearly all) of the animation was gorgeous.\n","\n","The absolutely bleak realisation that despite the ongoing struggle and sacrifice, over 600km worth of land is going to be trampled by the time they're able to fly.\n","\n","I expect the events with Annie's father caused a bit of an evacuation so maybe there's a chance for them to have fled on trains but still..\n","\n","There's no good ending here.\n","519: \t This episode suggests that the lives of Attack Titan holders are of a pre-deterministic nature. Even if this is only a special circumstance involving the Attack Titan, Founding Titan, and royal blood, the idea of a pre-determined life directly contradicts free will which Eren is so obsessed with. How is Eren \"free\" if he NEEDS to pressure Grisha into taking the Founding Titan? Was he not forced to make this choice? Did he have a choice at all?\n","524: \t HOLY SHIT. I fucking love this show. \n","\n","So much crazy stuff in this episode. I swear when Mikasa couldn't hear Armin I thought they were going to get stepped on or something.\n","528: \t Was anyone else confused as hell when they just introduced annie back into the story outta nowhere during a festival going on as the rumbling is still happening???\n","532: \t \\- Two minor characters gets to be in season 4\n","\n","\\- fucking dies\n","540: \t If the Attack Titan could see future inheritors memories, wouldn't Grisha be able to see that Eren was going to manipulate him and then in seeing that NOT kill the founding family?\n","543: \t That mountain Eren transformed into is fucking terrifying and we haven’t even had a proper look at it\n","548: \t Here we can see the gang teaming with the people that have been terrorising killing and basically plotting genocide for centuries? While also plunging paradise into chaos by getting them killed and eaten for as long as they remember by titans elemao.  \n","They are traitors, plotting with the people that have been killing their species, genociding using them as fucking bombs against other countries against the person that just wants their freedom and is forced to wipe out the rest of the planet AFTER THEY dECLAREd WAR ON THEM MIGHT I REMINd U.  \n","The story is going towards Eren failing but if this anime wants to portray real life until the end I hope Paradise disappears from the face of the planet once the world decides to kill them as they have already done, all of it while we see the face of these traitors in first plan I hope\n","553: \t Eren doing some Nazi shit\n","554: \t Lovely send off for Pyxis, and the absolute worst one possible for poor Nile.\n","\n","AND ANNIE IS OKAY!!!!!!!!!\n","559: \t I guess there is a metaphor of Ymir letting the pigs free and being punished for it and Eren trying to free Eldians.\n","\n","But I just don't see how Eren was convinced that wiping out the rest of the world is a solution to the Eldian problem. That is beyond genocide, it is an extinction level event.\n","562: \t Well that was goddamn awesome and my hype is back.\n","\n","1. Felt like 5 minutes (happens a lot with anime)\n","2.

These episode cliff hangers are a form of torture unto themselves\n","* So, time travel. I was roughly spoiled there was going to be an element of time travel, but that is the extent to which I was spoiled, which left me in the difficult position of not being able to really post in the manga thread (for fear of more Relevants) or the anime thread (for fear of spoiling accidentally); Glad to finally reach here and finally be able to discuss this.\n","* This is what I gathered from this episode on how Attack on Titan will tackle time-travel:\n","   * After this episode with all the 'future memories' stuff and Eren essentially influencing decisions that ALREADY happened, I am convinced this version of time travel is the 'fixed' version as seen in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.   \n","Essentially, 'past', 'present', and 'future' mean nothing, because everything has happened, is happening, and will happen.\n","   * As opposed to the other 2 types of time travel:  \n","The one with the 'butterfly effect', where going back in time to effect a change in the past leads to a change in the future (e.g., films like Back to the Future) or,  \n","The one with the multiverse, where going back to the past and making a change will create a divergent timeline (e.g., films like Avengers: Endgame or the 'Future Trunks' arc in Dragonball Z).\n","   * Basically, Eren's viewpoint of time is less of a stream, and more of like a flat piece of paper with all the information already on hand. His perception is similar to Doctor Manhattan in Watchmen.\n","* The most surprising (and terrifying) thing in this episode though is Grisha's reaction/pleading to Zeke (ZEKE! of all people, esp. since Zeke wants to euthanize every Eldian, a goal that is fundamentally against what Grisha stands for as a nationalist) to stop Eren's plan. Makes me really wonder how terrible/awful Eren's endgoal really is; and also holy hell I am so curious/excited to see what Eren's real endgoal is now.\n","* And one more for the road, THESE EPISODES GO BY SO QUICKLY.\n","598: \t Okay so WHAT is the deal with Goth Mikasa? I hope it's just an easter egg...\n","600: \t The way eren just said \"yeah my father is horrible and should never have been born, i agree with your plan\" at the third memory.. i was like \"dude is trying to speedrun this dialogue\"\n","601: \t Some of the best human vs human animation by Mappa. Although my only complaint is that some scenes do not have enough frames so it becomes choppy and hard to follow what's going on.\n","602: \t Amnie crying in the post credit scene another her home being destroyed and father dying is the epitome of irony.

I wish Magath's character had been developed more though. He went out in such a cool way, but I didn't feel that invested in his storyline. The only real glimpse we got into his psyche was a few lines of dialogue in episode 84. That was my only gripe though, great episode!\n","613: \t I noticed that the fake king puppet during Erwin's trial had the same pose than king Fritz during Ymir's sad backstory.\n","615: \t So is Eren, like, dead?

Made up a whole fake backstory to cement herself in history. Her desire to leave a mark on the world is genuinely terrifying\n","626: \t Why did Eren became aware of future memories when he kissed Historia’s hand? Why not before? Had he never touched Historia before?\n","629: \t It felt a bit rushed, but was nice seeing almost everyone I’ve wanted to meet up finally meeting up. I’ve always liked seeing characters from opposing groups putting their differences aside to achieve a common goal, and that still holds true here.\n","\n","No idea what they’re thinking to do against such unfavorable odds, but I’m looking forward to seeing what their plan is, and how they work together to put it into action.\n","635: \t This season has been such a huge payoff. The show has been littered with all sorts of hints and suggestions for years. I'd keep rewatching it and see new things and it's finally all coming together.\n","\n","I remember back in season 2 the ending showing three girls eating a body and thinking it must be a reference to the walls, but being so confused as to what the fuck that meant.\n","\n","Turns out?

Ymir was a product of war, Eren is a product of war, Marley instigated Paradis island, and throughout the series you see what war brings out of people  : violence, comeraderie, vengeance, greed, power, ideology, us vs. Them. The main argument of the show is that war is bad and will always escalate\n","656: \t How did eren have the physical strength to literally pull so hard on those chains that it destroyed his hands\n","661: \t I need Eren to hold me like he holds Ymir.😍\n","673: \t Omg Grisha telling Zeke to stop Eren gave me the shivers holy shit and here I thought last week that there was still something \"good\" inside of Eren. He literally convinced his father to kill children. I can't wait for next week's episode.\n","674: \t The Ymir flashback was something else entirely. Seeing something that's been talked about purely as lore as it actually was is always cool to see. I loved the choice to have her(as well as everyone else in the flashback) eyes blacked out all the way until Eren talks to her.\n","677: \t Anyone else feel like Annie's backstory was kind of shoe-horned in there, in the midst of everything else going on, just to give her a rushed character arc? She was a pretty major plot point and her coming back *should* feel momentous, but then she does a 180 on a dime while pouring out her exposition, and it just feels so contrived.\n","678: \t Why. Why. Why did Ymir help the King when he literally just ordered her to be killed? I just don't buy it that it's some form of Stockholm Syndrome. I really hope they justify Ymir's thinking.

But I guess Zeke will somehow bring him back with the founding power?\n","\n","I also don’t exactly understand why Zeke is the one with the power and got Ymir to listen to him, instead of it being Eren. Can someone tell me why?\n","\n","Ignoring that, we also finally got confirmation that Eren wasn’t going along with the euthanasia plan, which we all guessed! But we don’t really know what Eren’s plan is. Although now, he will just need to stop Zeke.\n","\n","I need next week! As I bet most of the characters will start to help Eren fight Zeke, even Eren’s enemies.\n","14: \t Anyone else feel like the introduction of Annie to the characters was a little rushed? Armin has been worried about her all this time and Connie saw innocent people slaughtered by her and neither of them seem really shocked to see her. I like the comedic scene to break stuff up a bit but also kinda jerks me since I think it’d work better if it was a bit more serious. \n","\n","Same think with Reiner seeing Annie. I know they weren’t really friends but you’d think he’d be a bit more excited to see her alive after all this time. Idk maybe we’ll get more of it next episode since it seems like all the characters will just be having a talk round a campfire next episode.\n","16: \t What a brilliant episode\n","\n","I'm speechless\n","\n","Burnt Colt, Porco eaten, Gabi sniping Eren, that stopped time.\n","\n","It seems kinda bullshit that Zeke undid the vow, but LETS GO EREN! KEEP MOVING FORWARD!\n","19: \t I screamed. I cant deal that Eren’s head got blown off (i mean he’s pretty much dead right other than the weird suspension of death with Ymir). I’m heartbroken I feel like whatever happens next, Eren Mikasa and armin won’t ever be reunited and the last time they will have been together will be when he told them all those horrible things. Ugh.\n","23: \t Holy fuck. I had to pause and shit when eren revealed he was never gonna go through with zekes plan and was so ready for him to be like \"Ymir lets get this rumbling shit started\" but Zeke always gotta butt in damn.\n","25: \t If Ymir created the bodies of all other Titans in the Paths, who created her titan body every time it was required before she died?\n","27: \t The opening scene was absolutely stunning. And no way Levi is dead, I'm sure Hange was lying just to escape. Who thinks so?\n","30: \t MAPPA went crazy this episode, insane ODM fights and animation, Falco titan design is so badass...\n","\n","Very beautiful scene between Keith and Theo, two old instructors from opposite sides forced to train kids into killers, but at the end they wanted nothing but their people to be safe and have normal lives and did everything for the good of them\n","34: \t The episode opening with Jean's wishes for his future really focused my mind on few things-\n","\n","1. In his dream, his wife is a long haired Mikasa (since he admitted to liking her long hair back in Season 1 I believe?)\n","\n","2. Doesn't Jean look a bit like Nile Dawk in that shot of him on the balcony?\n","Since the anime started focusing a bit more on Dawk from Season 2 and his relation his relation with Erwin, I get this de ja vu vibe between Jean and him.\n","\n","They share some personal traits and wishes - general build and face cut (more so with S4 Jean), scared of facing Titans (Jean overcomes it later on), being cautious and skeptical (trusting Eren's titan will be an asset), wanting to have a family and live safely in the interior, being good at leadership and understanding others (especially reflected in Dawk and Falco's interaction. It's like how Jean tests Marlo's resolve in S3). Dawk seems to be the person Jean would have ended up being if he hadn't opted to go to the scouts.\n","\n","Back in Season 2, when Erwin is imprisoned and Dawk is trying to suss out Erwin's plans and if he is just going to let it all end for him, Erwin hints at a big gamble he's played and that the one who chooses won't be him but others ( he looks at Dawk very sharply as if implying he is one of those others that Erwin is entrusting the choice too)\n","\n","This is reminds me immediately of Jean and Armin's interactions in crucial moments prior to Season 4 like the fight against the collosal titan. Initially Armin freezes up and asks Jean to lead and he mediates the situation but tells Armin that he can handle the execution but can't come up with a plan like Armin can (just like Erwin is more a strategist than Nile). \n","\n","The main difference between the Duos is that Erwin and Nile have different stances on life and have clearly chosen 2 different paths to walk down on. But Jean and Armin meet in the middle and are a bit more co-dependent (no shade meant, they are kids in a military situation after all) than the other duo. Their interdependence bolsters both of them to be their best versions without feeling the strain of shouldering everything alone.\n","\n","Anyone have any more thoughts on this? I'd love to hear :)\n","39: \t But, like, did Connie have to kill Samuel?? He had him pinned without a weapon and probably could have kept him restrained. I know it was paralleled with Armin's flashback to Berholdt's memory of \"someone has to be the one to stain their hands with blood\", but man, that was brutal.\n","44: \t why did eren limp all the way over to zeke when in the past he's just made a new titan (from the 3 he's able to make) to recover his body parts\n","46: \t So what's up with Zeke.  \n","I'm not sure of the significance of the vapor going in instead of out.  \n","And the memory, is it a confirmation that the rebirth power is linked to the Path?\n","55: \t It just hit me that like.... The titan powers aren't \"meant\" to be passed down. Like deadass only cause of King Fritz's sinister plans of feeding his daughters Ymir did this cycle of passing down Titan Powers start. Makes me wonder how the Titan powers would have looked if they had stayed with the same person... Would we have seen a difference in their life expectancy, etc.\n","62: \t Dude something so obvious hit regarding Connie's mom. She might die just from the rumbling itself. Then what would Connie do? Kill Falco or bring him back to the main city or just leave him there?\n","66: \t The emotional whiplash Yelena experienced from seeing her God in Zeke light up those Marley blimps and basking in their fiery destruction to watching said God get sniped by Magath and tumble off the Wall must have been something else\n","68: \t is it just me or did the spooky spine alien envelope Zeke as well at the end? Killing him? Consuming him? Zeke was shown (short hair) hearing Eren's message so he must be alive but maybe as part of Eren's colossus?\n","69: \t Hange: can you help my undying friend?\n","\n","Meanwhile Levi: It smell like Titans in here..\n","71: \t Fuck this episode was amazing. Sadly the fact that Falco ate Porco was spoiled, but it was an amazing moment either way. Seeing him turn into a titan while Colt held him was depressing. I’m sad to see Pixys and Niles go :( When Armin shot at Pieck with the thunder spear I was so hyped ! He’s come a long way since the beginning. Mikasa’s backward slash was badass as well.I  couldn’t help but smile when we saw old Eren again. Glad he’s back. Also, what is special about Nerd Armin and Goth amilasa? Who are they or where are they from?\n","72: \t So, Zeke is free from the king's promise \"somehow\", Ymir doesn't have will for some reason, and Zeke can use the coordinate without having the founding Titan? I'm confused\n","78: \t I had a good hunch that Falco would eat the Jaw. For a second I was worried I was wrong, but him getting the Armor would be too obvious. I somehow also felt that Zeke is playing Eren, because, well, it'z Zeke.\n","\n","Also again happy that they animated Beast's face properly. I prefered the Scream from the trailer though, without the yellow effect which is frankly kinda ugly.\n","92: \t I couldn’t stop crying watching Colt hold Falco as he transformed. As an older sister, I felt that so deeply. I’m just grateful we didn’t watch Falco eat him I couldn’t handle that\n","100: \t it was a cool episode but one thing I dont get. Why did Ymir go back to her oppressors after gaining her then god like titan power\\`? It doesnt  make sense does anyone have an idea\n","104: \t Wow. Is it ridiculous that I love murderous Eren? That FACE looking at Frieda was insane. I'm glad Zeke got some closure. I hope this means he finally dies! I've been waiting for so long\n","107: \t gabi with that winning aim taking down the reign of floch at last\n","108: \t Okay.. I really don't know who I want to win.  Eren's plan does make sense from his POV, but I don't like the Yeagerists at all.  seriously \"kill Mikasa, Armin, Connie.\"???  Eren would not want that at all.\n","109: \t samuel was saved by sasha back in season 1, but now connie -her \"twin\"- is the one that killed him, i guess isayama want to pack parallels in everything?\n","110: \t I fully angrily screamed at my TV when Jean pushed Floch out of the way and then 1 second later I realized what was happening and let out a sigh of relief\n","114: \t Unlike a lot of people in this thread, I really liked the direction this episode went. I understand it as the bounce back from the act 2 low point (the rumbling starting) completing a major theme of the series, the dangers of cooperation. Eren has united the worst of enemies, and I'm so happy seeing Reiner and Annie on the same side as the scouts again. The theme is also shown in Armin solving the Connie problem nonviolently and keeping both friends. When I saw that scene in the preview, I figured Armin would have to beat Connie, and it would be a small scale version of him accepting he has to fight his friends for good. (eren) I like this more though. I liked this episode and last episode for the thematic development, this one more though because the return of Annie really ties back to season one and hits that nostalgia, plus it brings back all the themes from the beginning that it looked like the series dropped. So good!\n","117: \t Attack on Liberio was revenge for all the sht our people on Paradise(and other countries they suppressed) went through and now Marley has the audacity to attack AGAIN!!! OMG Armin better start going out there and nuke these enemies that are basically fire squadding our people. Eren once again going 1v3 but this WarHammer powers are amazing. Anyways blame Marley for disobeying the Paradise king words that the world would be flatten if paradise was ever attacked. Also the euthanasia plan isn't all that bad like Armin said showcase the rumbling then leave them alone for 50 years. So Eren can do a mini rumbling then euthanasia Eldians then no more titans in the world. Supporting Marley is like literally supporting Naz1s in the aot world. Our group Mikasa, Armin, Connie, etc... need to help Eren since Marley's are Naz1s and will kill everyone on the Island.\n","118: \t It just struck me after watching a few times that Ymir probably isn’t going to go to the trouble of making any more titans after this, especially if their goal is to stop what’s happening, so are the other shifters like Armin, Falco, or Annie screwed? Reiner and Pieck are still in their titans, but it could be that that’s their last one for the time being.\n","120: \t Well that was a decent slow burner catch your breath kind of episode. Dont have as much to say about this one but a few thoughts\n","\n","1) Can i just say i really like Hitch? Like shes a pretty minor character but i like how shes just so chill and snarky but also pretty capable when push comes to shove (i know most of the top 10 cadets in her year went to scouts but she still got into MPs so she must have been in the top 20) Idk i just feel if i were to meet all the characters IRL shed be one of the only ones who id be friends with lmao\n","\n","2) LEVIS BACK! CONFIRMED TO BE STABLE! CHRIST ON A BIKE THEY DRAGGED THAT OUT! Although to be fair im not sure how much he can help at this point anyway. The simple days of S1 when 3D maneuver gear skill was King are long gone\n","\n","3) Wait so where exactly is Zeke right now? Is he dead crushed by Erens transformation and debris? Somewhere aboard the Rumbling Express with Eren? Did Eren consume him, claiming a 4th titan form? Or is he just....literally physically in PATHS making sand castles with Ymir?\n","\n","4) I know they drew attention to how the Rumbling hurt a lot of Eldians too with all the buildings collapsing but like....if the Titans are walking all across the world and some of them started DEEP INSIDE Paradis at WALL SINA, shouldnt they also be trampling all of   Paradis from at least one direction (not sure if theyre walking straight out in a circle or if half of them spun so that they're all walking one direction) I really like the narrative idea of the Rumbling but its one of those things thats making less sense to me the more i think about it.\n","\n","5) Shit thanks for the recap Armin, i didnt quite realise HOW fucked thing are til you broke down everything Point by Point. Armin Mikasa Jean and Hange are literally the only remaining reliables from RTS arc lol\n","124: \t I doubt there will ever be any answer, *(because what answer would be satisfying?)* but I really love the mystery of what entity gave Ymir the power of the titans.\n","\n","She falls in water, \"connected\" with some spinal cord jellyfish looking thing, bam. Is it an Eldritch god? A space alien? I don't think we'll ever know, but it's fun to think about.\n","127: \t Damn! Another crazy episode of fighting. Certain scenes had dope animation during the fights, but then there would be some weird shots that looked so funny to me. Like the scene toward the end when the boat was carrying the plane, it looked so off to me.\n","\n","Ignoring that, both the end and after credit scenes were so sad. Glad Keith finally made a difference. And poor Annie man. Just dead inside knowing she lost her reason to fight, and will now need to Jill someone she considers to be a friend at this point in the story.\n","\n","Next week the finale? Feels like no way we end it all there.\n","131: \t At what point could Eren have told Louise to throw away the scarf. When was it taken from Mikasa before the fight? She chose to leave it behind right before fighting but Eren obviously wouldn't have been talking to Louise after that point. Anyone know the answer?\n","134: \t The action scenes in this episode were superb... the music too. Brought me back to season 1.\n","\n","wtf is Annie going to think? I wonder if she heard the telepathy voice of Eren? Since he did it after all the titans were walking, I'd assume Annie was already out of the crystal, maybe unconscious? maybe woken up by the telepathy?\n","\n","Man... can't wait to see where this goes from here...\n","147: \t Could anyone remind me what that flashback (i'm assuming) scene was where someone says: \"someone has to be the one do do it... someone has to be the one to stain their hands with blood\" right as Conny's killing Daz and Samuel?\n","148: \t OMG, I got spoiled about the Rumbling and how Ymir got Titan powers but it was still amazing to see. But as always I have many questions:\n","\n","-Wtf is that weird spinelike thingy, where did it come from and why did it give Ymir Titan powers ?\n","\n","-How exactly did Ymir's power get passed down? I mean I guess that her daughters eating her makes sense but that would explain the shifters, what about Pure Titans, where did they come from?\n","\n","-Wtf is going to happen now? There's no stopping Eren, is it? It seems like the entire world is doomed.\n","\n","WHY ARE THESE EPISODES SO SHORT\n","\n","Btw it was kinda heartwarming seeing Eren comfort Ymir like that.Though he was just manipulating her into getting what he wants and used her to commit a mass genocide, it was wholesome for like 4 seconds.\n","151: \t Marley really came out guns blazing. It's not looking good for the Eldians right now, but that's about to change once all Survey Corps guys leave their jail cell and join the battle. The Cart's gun seem like a huge problem for Eren but as long as he doesn't just stand still it should be much more difficult for Magath to hit him where it hurts. \n","\n","If we didn't have enough factions already, Onyankopon now says that he's against Yelena and is only going along with it so he doesn't get his own head blown off. So now it seems like Armin and Onyankopon are on the same page, but Connie is still peeved and probably just wants to feed Eren to someone else. And Armin thinks that Eren has his own plan (the Rumbling?) and doesn't buy into Yelena and Zeke's plan either. \n","\n","It's looking like Hange will give Levi the titan serum to save him, but I wonder what happens next. He needs to transform immediately to heal his injuries, but there are no shifters nearby for him to eat. So does Hange just turn him into a Pure Titan and tie him down like Sawney and Bean? If there's anyone for the job it would be Hange, but that's sad yet hilarious state for Levi to be in. It'll be like Annie waiting in her crystal for years—Levi hanging out as a titan and being guarded from Jeagerists who would try to kill him. Although we're still not sure if Ackermans *can* turn into titans. Are they Eldians or Subjects of Ymir, and what's the difference between the two?\n","152: \t I just wanna put it out there that I called the attack titan being able to see the future for ages no and no ones believed me. Feels nice to finally be confirmed on that fact. \n","\n","God tho the realisation that eren made his father kill all those people is horrifying, I didn’t think it’d go that far. Also since eren controlled his father like that, maybe he’s been doing it with other attack titan holders? Influencing people like Kruger as well? How far back does it go?\n","155: \t y’all i’m confused, when Annie and Reiner transformed into titans and took Floch in the air with them using ODM gear, did he die from the heat? It was never really shown so now I’m confused\n","161: \t How did Armin and Mikasa survive? They are above the walls about to shoot the cart titan and then the walls collapse. Nothing to hook ODM gear on to\n","162: \t Ah so that's how Pieck puts on her machine gun.\n","163: \t 1. How did Eren manage to convince Ymir with just 2 sentences? WTF happened there?\n","\n","2. How did Ymir become a slave to the king even though she could've crushed him at any instant?\n","\n","3. How did Ymir's children get powers by eating the spinal fluid? When Rod Reiss tried that he turned into abnormal. How tf did the titan split into 9 titans?\n","\n","I have more questions than answers from this episode.\n","165: \t man, as always I'm left wanting more. I wish we really got more of the story in this episode. I guess two major takeaways in this episode are that Eren didn't/couldn't stop the titans from attacking his own folks. To me it seems like this is more of Ymir's doing, she's gone into absolute rage mode. Eldians didn't really do much for her when she was alive, so this is just Ymir finally becoming free and letting all the frustration go on the entire world. And honestly, that seems like the only reason why she even agreed to Eren for the rumbling. And the second takeaway is that Annie somehow holds the key to how the plot moves forward.\n","169: \t Mother of god, what an episode.\n","\n","* We finally got to see the history of Eldia. Ymir's life was so depressing.\n","* Eren's true plan is finally revealed. He doesn't just want to stomp Marley, he's going to try and crush the world. Holy fucking shit. \n","* I know this sounds weird....I'm kind of rooting for Eren. He's been our protagonist from the beginning and I just kind of fucking love it when the good guy goes bad. Maybe I'm not rooting for him, but fuck am I loving the fireworks right now. It's like when Anakin became Vader. I just love shit like this(in fiction). \n","* Hange and Levi are out there up to something right? I'm still wondering what's going on with Levi.\n","171: \t What an amazing episode. How tf Falco's titan is so different. Something different in his bloodline or something? RIP Shadis. Magath.\n","173: \t this episode feels like a recap episode, it's so rushed that it feels like this should've been at least 3 episodes.\n","\n","an episode focusing on falco's rescue and how they're dealing with it. an episode on annie's relationship with her friend and the eldians celebrating their freedom, then them (mikasa armin jean hange etc) planning to retrieve yelena & onyankopon. the next one is the retrieval and going to reiner.\n","187: \t Question: Why was floch so concerned about Mikasa once Jean got eaten by the cart?\n","190: \t Imagine all of this from Gabi's POV:\n","\n","You killed your enemy. You feel the recoil of the gun you used. You blink and the walls starts falling apart in the split of a second, even though his head fell off. He also started turning into a titan because fuck it.\n","\n","I'd shit my pants instantly.\n","196: \t Last episode really set this one up nicely. Connie has to kill his friends and get his hands dirty. He cries for them but soon he and the gang have to massacre their former comrades. On the other hand, they keep showing how smart Flock is and how he's fighting for the lives of their entire race. All the blood and gore really emphasizes the sacrifices being made on both sides. It's not just violence for violence's sake; there's a lot at stake here.\r  \n","\r  \n","General Magath is a goat for realizing what needed to be done and doing it. Although, Shadis didn't have to die. Bit of a needless sacrifice there, but I suppose his role in the story is over anyway.\r  \n","\r  \n","I swear, if we don't see some rumbling in the next episode I'm going to be pissed. They keep talking about Marlyeans getting stomped on across the sea and its so enticing that I can't focus on the excellent animation/directing going on in this episode. The OP being a banger and showing the rumbling ever episode doesn't help.\n","202: \t Did Paradis residents got killed by the walls coming down or they were tramped with the rumbling too?\n","\n","Armin realizing that Levi should have chosen Erwin was spot on. There was no way events would unfold this way and I would really wanted to see what would Erwin choose.\n","208: \t Ok so Pixis, Nile, Porco and Colt died in today's episode. Eren could maybe get out of the paths. The thing that I'm still thinking about is Gabi...there was like a 2seconds clip of her being shot in the head. Did anyone else catch it?\n","209: \t The episode was good. The fights were brutal, though I found it kind of funny that the Armored Titan is now beaten by a bunch of rocks. That armor got thinner the longer the show went it seems. I mean, it's also quite obvious that Gabi will use that Anti-Titan rifle at some point. Probably has to kill Falco who gets turned.\n","\n","Though, I disliked two things. One, how everyone is just buying Armin's points. Wasn't it the moment that Mikasa attacked Armin when he went for Eren that she realised that he might be right? And not just her headaches? Armin is so clear in denial and while I understand that they don't really have the time to talk it over, it feels weird that everyone is just buying what and how he sees.\n","\n","The second one is Zeke. There is no tension for me if he might die or not. They already showed that they need him for the plot and had to invent a new titan power for him to stay alive. There is no way he gets killed before he can touch Eren. This is why you shouldn't invent Deus Ex Machinas (even literally in this case) to let characters live, because it shows they won't die until they have at least fulfilled their purpose in the show.\n","218: \t Damn what did that one guy do to Mikasa? She cut off his head, skewered his body to the other guy, and then blew them both up\n","221: \t I don't know if any of you caught this but when the Marleyan guard's gun goes off when Mr. Leonhart was fighting him, it was the same sound effect of Floch's gun going off at the time while Keith is in his cell. My prediction is Karina Braun was shot cause she was right in front of them.\n","224: \t Well that was uncharacteristically fun one lmao. Some thoughts\n","\n","1) Interesting how Hange ponders if the reason Levi wasnt turned into a Titan was because of his Ackerman blood. I mean as it happens WE know its because Levi just didnt drink any wine but i wonder if shes right regardless, and if that will become important later.\n","\n","2) Loved how Falco looked genuinely surprised when Gabi told him Connie was trying to feed him to a Titan. Kid was like \"damn i genuinely thought this was just about Dental Hygeine\"\n","\n","3) Feel like a lot of people are mad about that Annie scene but if i had been in conscious suspended animation for 4 years my first thought would probably be food too lmao\n","\n","4) Pieck i get your plan was to rescue Jean and co and that the Cart isnt much in a straight fight BUT if you wanted to quickly snap Floch in two i dont think anyone would mind lol\n","\n","5) Poor fucking Jean. He wants SO BAD to be self centered dick that only cares about living the good life and yet TIME AND TIME again he cant help but being a good and noble man. \n","\n","6) I like to think when Hange said \"its up to Armin and Pixis now\" was the EXACT moment Armin thunder-speared him.\n","\n","7) Was that guy watching Annie Shadis? The silhouette looked like a bald lean man and hes kind of the only unaccounted for character right now\n","\n","8) Was gonna complain about Hitch not getting to join the crew but then i thought of Marlowe Miche Nanaba Gelgar Levi Squad and every other secondary that spent 5 fucking minutes with these people and was like \"Yknow what probably best you sit this one out sweetie\"\n","\n","9) That ending was very classic Shonen-y/Avengers-assembl-y which is interesting cause my like lower half brain was like \"HELL YEAH THIS SOOO COOOOOL\" but my higher more critical brain was like \"oh....no... nonono the other shoe is gonna drop any second now\"\n","\n","10) and Finally poor fucking Reiner. Man trys to get 5 minutes of peace and wakes up to 4 people who have either tried to kill him or beat the shit out of him on multiple occasions\n","229: \t The action and animation this episode was incredible, while at the same time not being fun to watch.\n","\n","It felt like watching a murder.\n","\n","Yeagerists killed today were the soldiers from the background scenes, who supported the fight for humanity or in some cases children who grew up inspidered by our heroes...just to be murdered by them today.\n","\n","I'm fully aware that the entire world is at stake and I never supported Eren, but this episode made me understand just how these people feel. \n","\n","As a viewer you see the female titan and think about Levi's squad and all the scouts she killed, you see Armored and think how Reiner broke the wall, you remember how both of them murdered Marco - I don't want to support them. I don't want to see the them win and kill the Eldian troops who I've supported for 9 years of watching this show.\n","\n","I'm sure my feeling will change once we see the thousands Eren killed, but it's probably what would change the mind of many in-universe people - seeing the Rumbling in effect. To them Eren crashing all other countries is a distant hard to imagine act that brings them salvation. It's a mentality Jean nearly fell in to.\n","230: \t Im not saying the last few episodes were bad or anything but i think speak for a lot of us when i say we could do with good ol high stakes action episodes. Some thoughts\n","\n","1) One problem i have with the show in general is its tendency to treat secondary characters just as cannon fodder and not really give them much personality and i think that Daz and Samuel made that fact much more glaring. Its clear they were going for an \"OH SHIT\" Moment where Armin and Connie are forced fight there old friends to the death and it was still a great scene but like...... Who are these people lmao \n","\n","It was a good call back and i still feel awful for Connie but i think it would have worked better if someone like Marlowe was still around to lend it more weight than just 2 redshirts lol\n","\n","\n","2) QUIT PLAYING COY FALCO. We all know your going to have to run in at the last minute and bail them out, get in there and use Floch like a chew toy, i want to see that sweet sweet new Jaw Design\n","\n","3) THE FEMALE TITAN ITS BEEN A WHILE. Crazy think considering what a threat she was back in Season 1 that we're now rooting FOR her to kill scouts lmao.\n","\n","4) Armin uses the Colossal so infrequently i deadass forgot he could regenerate for it a minute there and thought he was actually dead lol\n","\n","5) Fuckin Floch. I always had a little sympathy for his viewpoint seeing what he went through but his conversation with Azambito confirmed that even if the Yeagerist do win he still plans to live like tyrant over regular Paradis citizens really drained my last drop of patience with him. Fuck you utterly Floch lets all place bets on who gets the pleasure of ending you. My moneys on Hange \n","\n","6) Weve all been there Armin. You try to take the stealth approach, you slip up in front of one guard, the cockup-cascade begins next thing you know your drowning in corpses\n","231: \t \n","\n","Why did Eren shout stop to Zeke before wanting to scream and turn call the titans? Does he even know about Falco drinking Zeke's wine?\n","\n","**FUCK FUCK FUCK**\n","\n","Eren??? EREN???!?!?!?!?!?!?!? \n","\n","If I have an erectile dysfunction, this episode is definitely the reason, and I'm still in minute 12.\n","\n","Wait Wait, was that goth Mikasa and nerd Armin? The ones from the real life teenagers AOT official art or something????\n","\n","Eren got played with like a fiddle.\n","\n","Unfortunately I got the decapitated head manga page spoiled on me, you are telling me that manga readers waited **AN ENTIRE MONTH????**\n","\n","I am going to KO myself now, can't wait for the nex\n","236: \t Armin and Connie gave me chills. The scene reminded me of other civil war films like the Wind that Shakes the Barley, where former comrades are pitted against one another. Soul-shattering stuff.\n","237: \t One thing I don’t understand is how when a shifter dies without feeding itself to another inherotor the titans power go to a random eldian baby born. How is that possible? We see that you need the spinal fluid of the titan? And in this episode we see this creature looking thing is transferred to a new host and that’s how they receive their power. How does a new born baby get that and how does it randomly become a shifter if it never ate or came near the spinal fluid?\n","240: \t When Mikasa and Armin were staring at each other saying “All the hardening” I was thinking the exact same thing as them. I can’t wait to see Annie again.\n","242: \t So the last two episode is basically:\n","\n","-Eren draw an uno reverse card on Zeke\n","\n","-then Zeke draw an uno reverse card on Eren\n","\n","-finally Eren draw ANOTHER uno reverse card on Zeke, then T-posed on him\n","247: \t [The implication-](https://imgur.com/b7UChJJ) ...Aaand [there it is.](https://imgur.com/GeMWNWV) - [Called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/td9apt/attack_on_titan_the_final_season_episode_85_anime/i0jmhka/?context=3), was expecting the situation to be a bit more dire though, and at least it wasn't hidden that Falco would try to join in. Was completely blindsided by Shadis though, that was a pretty good twist.\n","\n","[How come Falco's titan looks like this?](https://imgur.com/H6scAUt) Why did Ymir get the discount Jaw??\n","\n","[And why does the seawater look like wine?](https://imgur.com/xh3KC9Z) I guess its supposed to be blood, but how is there so much of it in the ocean? Only a couple of dudes have gone in\n","\n","Favourite scene of the episode was definitely [Connie to the rescue](https://files.catbox.moe/tyeoej.mp4), I think that's the most action our boy has ever gotten in one sitting? Also shout out to the one homie who worked as body armour for him\n","250: \t So is Falco's titan is definitely a beak titan, amirite?\n","\n","\n"," Also just realised; Falco - Falcon + he always dreams about flying = birb like titan\n","253: \t The Camera work was insane. Colt pleading and Porco, hit different :( I refuse to accept whatever happened to Colt, that's just not it.\n","\n","Eren and Zeke throwing UNO reverse cards at each other like damn\n","259: \t I did have to give Flotch some bonus points this episode though. He was smart and capable, just outgunned by seconds by others who are also now the elite soldiers of this world. \n","\n","That was hard. I wanted Armin's plan to work so bad, for them to get what they wanted without resorting to violence against the islanders. I wonder what the significance of the Yelena-Levi moment was, her saying you can't take the violence out of people, right Capitan? Levi's obviously setting up to come back in a big way, I wonder if that will be significant. \n","\n","Two episodes left? This is 150,000% going to end in a movie or special, nowhere near resolved\n","267: \t What's really interesting to me is that Floch was actually a really good leader. He might have been a sociopath, but he was genuinely smart.\n","\n","It's really hard to watch Eldian soldier die, it's just as Floch said, if they fail, their friends and family will be exterminated in revenge...\n","270: \t If the author is trying to make me hate the 104th more than I already do, he is doing a great job. Jean is trying to make excuses for how this was somehow deserved or inevitable, most likely in order to escape his own responsibility for it. Eren would not be in this position without the 104th defending him at every turn out of blind faith, even after being betrayed and having every sign that Eren could not be trusted. \n","\n","Him and Connie are now debating who they should feed Falco to, without any regards to his right to his own life. People are only tools to them, to be used for their abilities and discarded when they are no longer useful. And even when Armin disagrees, it is only a practical consideration, with no concern for things such as right and wrong. It’s sadly to be expected from Armin at this point, he has long since replaced his brilliant mind with a blind faith in Eren.\n","\n","The lack of humanity in these characters is absolutely appalling. They are completely disillusioned with life and it is pretty pathetic, when not infuriating, to watch them continue to lie to themselves and evade reality. They really are the fallen birds whose wings have been burned. Faced with the horror of what they have brought about, they can only try to justify their past actions and deny that they ever had a choice. That whole line from Jean (the people of the world brought this upon themselves) is exactly the same philosophy of Carl Fritz and Zeke which they were once rebelling against. \n","\n","Gabi on the other hand is the sole beacon of light left among the major characters. A clear parallel to the hero that Sasha used to be (before she turned to the dark side by invading Liberio), she also represents the true answer to the show’s eternal question of how to deal with the cruelty of the world. She suffered through the same horror and devastation of her home as Eren, but unlike him and Bertholdt, who made it past their initial prejudice but continued on the same path of evil as before, she is rising above it and now seeks to make things right.\n","\n","And she is also different than someone like Mr. Blaus who, while also wanting an end to the perpetuation of evil, acts only as a peacemaker / pacifist, Gabi is willing to fight in order to secure justice. This represents a union between two answers which on their own are insufficient. The false peace and complacency of Zeke which is powerless to stop the evil or even aids it, and the indiscriminate rage and destruction of Eren which will only perpetuate it in the other direction. The hero integrates the good of both, in having a raging determination to fight, but directing it only towards those individuals who are deserving of it. That is why Gabi is the only true hero left in this story, and why people are deceiving themselves by being Eren apologists. There IS another way, which Armin wished for at one point, and only those who have the courage to use their minds will ever find it.\n","274: \t Just all of the pressure coming from every angle of this situation pushing poor Armin to a breaking point. Felt bad for him when he had his little breakdown as well as Mikasa with that quiet ‘Sorry’ for setting him off. Erwin really did make it look so easy even though he was dealing with his own pressure\n","276: \t This episode was incredible, \n","But still didn't understand everything.\n","\n","does  Eren see the future I mean everything, or just the a glimbse of what the next attack Titan will see (as if he was looking through his eyes)!?.\n","\n","If he can see everything ( then Eren father  also did), and Eren did see his father's memories and what he saw of the future, does that mean eren knew exactly what gonna happen or when did he came aware of the future !!!?\n","282: \t Wow that Connie face was just like Yelena face when she looked over Armin. I can see why their trying to stop Eren it's unprecedented genocide of billions. Yeagerists still see it as a win tho since if everyone is killed outside the walls then they kill all the non-eldians on the Island then Eren can just wipe the memories and all would be good for sometime. But as long as there is more than one human on Earth there will always be conflict. Even if they do stop Eren they can't and wont get rid of the hatred the world has for the Island as it would just postpone their destruction. There's also no functional government on the island anymore so Yeagerist essentially control the island and it would be hard for the group to go back as they'd betrayed Eldia. Wonder why they saved Yelena tho. None the less that last shot looked like the Avengers assembling.\n","\n","I'll still be with the Yeagerist cause it'd be my home and if you attack my home I will seek your destruction. I'll dedicate my heart to die free just like how the Ukrainians are doing.\n","286: \t It was cool to see through the Yeagerists–the main team's former comrades experience–of how the betrayal was through their eyes... seeing the Marley titans destroying their forces along with their former friends. You could really feel the pain in their expressions and then when Connie finished those two off by defending Armin, that was so sudden and impactful\n","287: \t Incredible episode, the fact that Eren actually lost his head but was catched by Zeke in the last second is amazing.\n","\n","I also like the subvertion of the rule. Everyone thought the royal blood Titan was a key for a non-royal Founding Titan to achieve the full power of the Founder. But it was the opposite all along, but nobody could have known that because every single Founding Titan that has existed was always of royal blood, so people thought the power was in the fact of holding the Founding Titan, but the power was actually in the royal blood, it was the Founding Titan that was a key to get to the Coordinate so the royal blood individual can actually ask Ymir in that place.\n","288: \t Is Pixis the first time we’ve seen Armin kill a titan? Can anyone think of another? (sans bertholt)\n","293: \t Wait mikasa could also hear eren and was seen in the coordinate plains. I thought she was half Ackerman and half from the azumabito clan. How was she able to go into the coordinate plains and hear eren when she isn’t a subject of Ymir. Does that mean she can inheret a titan now?!!!!\n","302: \t Funny how eren was willing to die in uprising in chains after seeing memories of Grisha killing the Reiss family, while his future self told Grisha to do it while in chains\n","303: \t Reiner is just loved by Annie's kick.\n","305: \t Sure, Yelena made up some details regarding her history after drinking the Monkey King Kool-Aid and sure, Yelena took being called out like that to air out some grievances about everybody else at the campfire and sure, all of this stemmed from Yelena seeing her Monkey King get sniped by Magath and then eviscerated by Eren using the Founding Titan, but hey, even she found Sasha getting shot pretty sad, so maybe she is .001% less crazy than we think she is... right?\n","307: \t Okay so now that everyones sort of coming together to deal with Eren and the rumbling theyre OBVIOUSLY going to address that between the battles of Liberio, Shiganshina and just 2000 years of war everyone in this alliance has more beef than a steakhouse, but here are just a few bits of dramatic irony and personal vendettas that may or may not be brought up\n","\n","Jean doesnt know that Annie and Reiner killed Marco\n","\n","While Reiner knows Bertholt was eaten he probably doesnt know Armin was the one who ate him\n","\n","Jean hurled a thunder spear right at Falco in Liberio\n","\n","Pieck is the only reason Levi was unable to Kill Zeke in Shiganshina\n","\n","Im sure theres more but those are the ones that come to my mind\n","322: \t This episode was loaded with so much that's prime for debate and interpretation on the \"main idea\" of the series.\n","\n","To name a few:\n","Magath's \"justification\" and his glances at Gabi (an Eldian), Annie saying they wouldn't have destroyed the walls--does that change when they begin to kill their friends, Eren telling Reiner that he would've destroyed the walls too--which IMO puts another wrench into the Marley-Eldia blame game that the series has put upon us, us as viewers seeing \"talking\" and \"peaceable\" options fail (what does that mean for the future with Eren and beyond?), is fighting always unavoidable, Armin not wanting to stand by with clean hands, 104th's own means vs ends conundrum, is the ends even worth it?, killing their own people and friends to save a world that might continue to hate them--Lady Azumabito and Yelena put it well, humans will always find a way to fight and the Rumbling only shrinks the population, us that are critical of Eren because we find his strategy pointless must also look at the futility and self-destructiveness of \"saving the world\", does that mean nothing is worth it? Maybe the series is saying that bloodshed won't stop but can be reduced???\n","\n","AAAAH. THat's way more than a few lmaoo \n","\n","A good number of people are tuning out from the season because the spectacle has died down a bit but for me, this and the last episode have been some of my favorites.\n","327: \t For the people that don't remember, the promess mentioned by Samuel was initially formulated by Sasha in Season 1 Episode 4 on the top of Wall Rosa in Trost district. This was followed by the appearance of the Colossal Titan and Sasha saving Samuel from falling to his death after he was knocked-out by a falling rock.   \n","That promess was reminisced in Season 4 Episode 8 when Eren has a flashback of Sasha following the announcement of her death.\n","338: \t I don't understand what's happening. My mind is as blown as they first shown Marley.\n","\n","What the fuck is that spine thing? An alien? A bacteria? A deep sea creature? What the fuck.\n","\n","What the fuck is that creature Eren transformed into? Do you mean to tell me that the Shinzou wo Sasageyo opening was not a fake, and there are whale titans and shit? What the fuck.\n","\n","What the fuck is happening. We knew rumbling was coming, but what the fuck.\n","\n","I am an adult and I need an adult\n","\n","Poor founder Ymir, jesus is her story sad. Was just helping out her little village, was forced to slave away, was forced to take blame, forced to bear children, forced to kill people..\n","\n","The parallel that we see with nowadays (RIP) Ymir. \n","\n","Eren is also talking to literally every single Eldian, because even the ones in Marley can hear them. The man's a literal god right now. What a transformation. \"You are as powerless as ever\" - This was said today, and by Eren himself in Season2.\n","\n","I knew that when Zeke said she obeys the commands of royal blood, that Eren will make a point to free her. He's all about freedom and Ymir is a literal slave, for eternity. \n","\n","Season 2 is GOATed now, I don't care. So many callbacks. \n","\n","What the fuck is that creature\n","339: \t Seeing Eren beat the shit out of Porco while also having his hands full with Reiner was something else. He struggled so much against him in Liberio and would've probably been defeated if not for Levi and Mikasa's help.\n","340: \t So on to some good old titan against 3DMG !!! So it continues where it left off on last episode. Eren on the march with the wall titans and seems like almost everyone got the message that he said. Reiner seems like he is absolutely done for and saying Eren can't be stopped. And like I said too.\n","\n","What in the world can stop Eren? Gabbi on the action again. Actually saving Kaya the kid from the farm who was saved by Sasha ironically back in the older seasons \\^\\^ . Everyone kinda depressed. Jean knows quite a lot of stuff it seems but damn Conny... Now that they took Falco and I mentioned that usually newly formed titan might be hard to control or just weak. And falco is just fully fainted. Conny wants to use Falco on his mom so that she can turn into human. Jean was like \"Yea let's use him on Pyxis\". And I was like... Hmm.. Ok idea. But Conny straight up \" NO JEAN\".\n","\n","Thanks that Armin somewhat still stable, though in shock suggesting not to use Falco as there is enough bloodshed already. But Conny straight up jumping on Armin too like \"NOPE ARMIN YA WERE SAVED TOO BUDDY!\". And I was like damn Conny..\n","\n","Yelena is devestated. Zeke is done for too it seems. Shadis is still going strong!!! Let's go dude! Get those recruits up!\n","\n","I really did miss this titan vs 3DMG action! And damn... Armin and Mikasa seeing Pyxis being titan now and they being like \"thanks for everything\". And armin goes to finish his suffering.\n","\n","Oh right, and we see at the end. Eren seems to have taken out all of titans' hardening ability.. Soo Titans like Annie which was hardened all this time is now free.\n","\n","Back to more combat focused episode which is very nice and like I said I'm very pleased to see the actual titan vs human action! Though it seems all the titans just absolutely got demolished here \\^\\^ . Will be interesting to see what Annie brings. Overall episode solid 8.5/10. Again looking forward to next week :)\n","343: \t I’m so surprised how fast the episode seemed to go by. I wanted to know more about Annie and what her part, if any, has to impact the overall story.\n","\n","Perhaps there is a power that the Female Titan possesses that were not aware of that comes into play later? \n","\n","Overall it was a good, nostalgic episode. Returning to the ODM Titan-fighting action that got us all hooked in three first place. I really want to see a close up of Eren’s founding Titan though…\n","344: \t The old style ODM gear and uniforms and the throwback music was a really nice touch at this point. It's gotten so dark at this point, there was a nice bit of F Yeah Humanity back in there, and the gang are so good at killing titans at this point.  Shadis getting his moment as the hero was nice - not just a Bystander. \n"," \n","Gabi killing the titan and Kaya imagining Sasha there with her bow, oh my heart, excellent callback to the kindness of Sasha still impacting the world a little at a time.  \n"," \n","Everyone's all who's going to eat who but where the F is Levi and Hange! If he can't become a titan because Ackerman something he's probably still out for this arc though  \n"," \n","Did end right at the exciting part though, I actually went \"Ahhh whhyy!\". Annie is no doubt going to be important here, but what a moral mess, for her it was probably an instant since freezing and from killing all those people, she's still 16, when everyone's been through so much since then and the whole situation has changed many times.\n","345: \t Annie: Has been in one battle since she woke up and already wants to quit. \n","\n","Reiner: All his family in Liberio are dead, he caught Thunder Spears with his face to save Annie, got pummeled within in inch of his life (again), and is already ready for the next battle. Suffering means nothing to this man anymore. \n","\n","---\n","\n","I'm glad that Shadis got a fitting send off. He always compared himself to Erwin and Shadis's courage and self-sacrifice at the harbor are reminiscent of Erwin's final charge. Even though he felt like he lived as a bystander, he died as a hero. I'm reminded of this quote from the Pearl Harbor Memorial: *\"Acts of heroism that day were many and not all recorded.\"*\n","349: \t I am really confused about two things:\n","\n","Why Ymir decided to serve the king after transforming to Titan, when he clearly abuse her? It doesnt looked like people transforming have to lose their human memories and wishes.\n","\n","And why Armin was so happy that Eren won, when he could not know that by the single fact rumbeling started, as if Zeke succeed he would start rumbeling anyway to scare people off so they leave Eldians die out naturally (it was part of his plan that Hanji read out loud to pretty much everybody).\n","350: \t Pieck: Hey Porco help me out and cut these chains off me, right buddy?\n","\n","Porco: Why would I do that when I can just cut your whole arm off?\n","\n","I'm so damn excited that this is back and what an episode to start off with, had a smile on my face the entire time, especially during the Pieck scene above.\n","\n","I expected that the attack they had prepared would be intense, but not quite to the point of disaster in mere minutes, and definitely a good follow on from where we left last episode without too much catch up or reintroduction to what was happening. That fighting was brutal and some of the stills and close ups looked great, [like Reiners](https://imgur.com/FbU5nIJ), though I did laugh at of course poor Reiner would be the one being smashed to pieces *again*. Dude can't catch a break. Shiganshina can't either, at this point I feel like they should just give up on that city with how many times it's been a battle ground\n","\n","Can't wait to see how this battle progresses now that there's so many different factions involved, even if there's just two sides on the surface it's certainly a lot more fractured then that and I'm curious if those fractures will come up once things get going.\n","\n","My only thing is that I feel Connie's pain over the idea of \"Why should we help Eren if it means none of us can have kids\" would hit harder if we had ever followed up on the situation with his mother being transformed, especially when they had Zeke in custody and after Sasha who was his other family was killed, and having that follow through on his loss of family being pushed forward.\n","\n","That ED was gorgeous though, particularly [some of](https://imgur.com/Y7HUxiH) the [scenery shots](https://imgur.com/InnwyBL)\n","352: \t I don’t know about y’all, but all of these people coming back in season 4 is difficult for me. I don’t remember like any of them, they would show up once and disappear. So I saw the scene with Conny, Armin, Daz and Samuel and I felt no emotion, I have only seen the two of them like three times EVER, so why would I care. \n","\n","Even Floch is the same way, I didn’t remember him until someone told me who he was. It just doesn’t hold any weight for me.\n","354: \t 1. I'm really hoping for best with Falco but Zeke isn't really known for his compassion. I can't think of one time where he was like \"oh, I better not\" or gave a crap about any casualties at all. Especially when his goal is soooo close. It also worries me that Falco said all that stuff to Gabi. I hope his whole arc wasn't just a way to give Gabi character development. I really like him!\n","\n","2. Where the heck is Levi ;(\n","\n","3. Eren is so cool lol poor Reiner\n","358: \t Well that episode felt quick.\n","\n","I will try and post on every single episode except episode 1 of part 2 because I already mentioned it in my thoughts on AOT season 4.\n","\n","Damn that Yelena angry face on Armin :D Hahaha. But what in the world... Armin... Are you being manipulated too? Like Eren?..\n","\n","I already saw this weird action from Armin at the ending of S4 Part 1 when Yelena puts the OG squad into cell and Armin is reacting something like \"That made me emotionally moved\" when Yelena talked about their plan...\n","\n","That just sounded so weird of him...\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","Eren can sustain a lot of damage. \n","\n","Glad to see Gabbi finally starting to think unlike in part 1.\n","\n","I hated her character. But if she changes for the better she might just be forgiven.\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","Exciting ending anyway. Will Zeke get his victory? Will he use the shout to turn almost all who drank the wine into titans?\n","\n","But most importantly... I miss old Eren ...\n","\n","It would be amazing if he instead of being used by Zeke, he would at one point drop that scummy ape.\n","359: \t This show really makes you go back and forth.  Before this it was sort of crazy when you see other anime-onlies siding with Yeagerist and Eren.  All we've seen from them is deception of their own people, killing the command before them, xenophobic behavior and Eren committing genocide.  It's quite hypocritical of them to call the survey corps traitors when they literally had just killed all of the survey corps except for our main cast from the 104th and Levi/Hange.  Then killed all of the Upper command from both Military Police and Garrison plus countless others who got caught up in the fighting.  Seems pretty traitorous to me.\n","\n","Then you see they are actually dedicated to their cause and really believe it is the only path forward to save themselves.   Before it always looked like they just enjoyed being in positions of power and they were doing it simply for revenge.  I rooted for the main cast and Annie + Reiner.  It was tough watching Connie kill his friends, but then you see him, Jean and Mikasa killing so many more.  It re-enforced the theme of there being no right or wrong, no winner or loser in war and just everyone suffering.  Both groups were traitors, yet both groups were just doing what they thought was right. \n","\n","The Jaw seems really unique in that it manifests differently each time the owner changes.  Ymir was almost like a Golem from LOTR type creature.  Porco had a bone face and claws and Falco is bird-like.  I got spoiled on Falco becoming the Jaw from youtube thumbnails and saw he had what looked like fur/feathers.  I thought this was because he would also eat Zeke somehow, but now I see that wasn't even necessary.\n","\n","I was scared for Pieck when she was running from the thunderspears and I thought it was over once Falco got her.  I figured someone would die, but I didn't think it'd be Magath the Commandant.  I think they went out in a good way.  The old commander of the Survey Corps and the old Commander of the Warriors both died to save nations other than their own, since Paradis is likely going to be fucked and Marley is pretty much done for any moment by the rumbling.\n","362: \t No way is Levi dead he's a main character and they gave damn Marco's death more of a focus and Hange was quiet about Floch being able to read pulses no way in hell is he dead\n","363: \t Thoughts:\n","\n","* Another fire speech from Floch. Also cant believe the moves he was putting on Hange, Beast , and Cart Titan.\n","* Feels weird seeing Mikasa team up with Reiner and Annie. I lied its not weird it fuckng sucks. \n","* Mikasa is a goddamn savage. That move when she tied the 2 Jaegerists ODM cords was ridiculous. \n","* The Shadis and Magath sacrifice was amazing. Gained a lot of respect for Shadis this season. \n","* Conny definitely leveled up.\n","374: \t I'm kind of impressed with myself that I was able to predict what Reiner was gong to say at the end of the episode: \"Eren, omae da!\" It was a clear parallel to what he said when he found out he was the Coordinate.\n","\n","The amount of parallels in this story is disgustingly good.\n","\n","I also really liked the scene with Gabi standing up, about to presumably thank the Braus family for forgiving her, until the one who was saved by Sasha said that she wished she could've killed her. Gabi then sat back down, showing that it was their kindness that broke the cycle, only for her gratitude to quickly be extinguished upon the kind of violence that perpetuates it. The symbolism with the birdcages was also pretty good, as was the shot of an opened birdcage once Falco started to speak.\n","\n","Also, that shot of Zeke looking down from the wall at Eren was so good. Rule of thirds, baby.\n","380: \t Cliffhangers, I want to know Levi state, more about the little girl , also what's with Eren, Armin said he is playing Yelena , I'm  sad for Mikasa ,she seems hurt , so if Ere  has other motive I will take it ,what could it be ,I'm so curious 🤔  , liked the episode but omg finished fast, I blinked then it is over hehe,  all in all I like it\n","386: \t So, are some Titans, like Conny's mom complete deformed messes because when Ymir made them out of sand she just didn't want to put the work into doing it right?\n","389: \t 1. Holy crap, Falco? No, he won't be eaten. I refuse to believe it. Nah, actually, it totally won't happen. No way the story just builds a new main character up for him to become titan, inherit Jaw, and then get fed all to save Connie's mom of all people. \n","\n","2. Annie's back guys! Finally. She's missed a lot.\n","\n","3. Where is Levi? Is he safe? Is he alright?\n","\n","4. So... what'd you think of Gabi now guys?\n","\n","5. Commander Shadis is back, baby!\n","395: \t I only came on here because I don't like how much information Yelena has on everyone in that group.   \n","\n","\n","Assuming that the only people who know exactly what happened to Marco are Annie(who has been essentially a rock for a majority of the story), and Bertholdt(who has been uh, dead, for quite a while), and Reiner, that means that maybe Reiner told her? But I can't think of a good time for when he would explain this to her, assuming that he spent a majority of his time in Paradis, then left for Marley, and then Yelena went to Paradis after Reiner had left. I can maybe excuse this because there was some time in between when they could have met each other, but it still bothers me because I can't seem to recall much of a connection to Yelena and Reiner at all. Then I thought harder on this, and I was wondering. Why did Yelena want to call them out for Marco? The major significance to this is Jean. So it seems like she wanted to press Jean's buttons or something, but I don't exactly see why Yelena would know why this is so significant to the people there.\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","ANYWAY, I tried to let this part go. And then I looked back, and I noticed another thing.\n","\n","How the hell does Yelena know that Jean fired a thunder spear at Falco? You expect me to believe that amidst all of the chaos in Liberio, Yelena had the clarity to look up in the sky, identify Jean specifically, watch him launch a thunder spear, and then look down and engrave it in her mind that Jean attacked Falco? and then have the hindsight to bring this up to try and stir trouble in this campfire situation. I dunno, I just really wanna call bullshit on this unless Yelena reveals that she has a crystal ball in the upcoming episodes, lol.\n","397: \t Alright, in I go. Penultimate episode of the show technically, assuming there's a movie instead of a \"Season 4 Part 3.\"\n","\n","\"So much for stealth!\" - Barney Calhoun\n","\n","Annie is doing her Annie thing, as Annie does. Honestly I kinda missed her signature carnage.\n","\n","Jesus, if the engineers need half a day, and Eren's already reached Marley, that's gonna be a hell of a lot of destruction before they can get anywhere near him. Also weird seeing Magath in a Survey Corps coat.\n","\n","The stupid flying boat is starting to sound like a lot more trouble than it's worth. If it's just about getting close to Eren, I'm pretty sure Falco or Annie could carry people in in a tenth of the time.\n","\n","Second to last time for this intro. It'll be a bittersweet farewell next week, I think it's been my fourth-favorite (which is REALLY high praise for AoT)\n","\n","Jesus, if Magath in the Wings of Freedom is trippy, compare Mikasa and the Female Titan working together. \n","\n","Floch is surrounded by several of the most dangerous people in Paradis, all his enemies, can he PHUCKING DIE NOW!?\n","\n","And once again, Reiner gets to act as the Shield.\n","\n","* Annie: (fighting) \n","* Female Titan theme: (I sleep) \n","* Pieck: (appears) \n","* Female Titan theme: (REAL SHIT!?)\n","\n","Alright, I guess Falco's gonna fight. Really hoping he gets to be not-a-liability.\n","\n","Oh shit, Annie is FUCKED RIGHT UP. Reiner too, but that's normal at this point\n","\n","Oh my god Connie is unleashing all of his torque\n","\n","The animation this episode is legit, they really pulled out all the stops\n","\n","Lol Pieck literally did Gorosaurus' thing from Destroy all Monsters\n","\n","#OH MY GOD FALCO'S JAW LOOKS FUCKING METAL AS SHIT, but also kinda like Xavier Renegade Angel\n","\n","BIIIIIIIIIIRD\n","\n","Ashes on the Falco\n","\n","Okay for as much as I'm rooting for his demise I gotta admit Floch cut a pretty good jig there\n","\n","what grape juice why\n","\n","Mickey is a fucking BUTCHER, I'm gonna need to watch that three more times\n","\n","I'm still a little vague on why Floch's thunder spear made a wine explosion.

This would actually be a good end for these two.\n","\n","Rest well, old soldiers.\n","\n","Looks like something after the credits too, one sec\n","\n","Damn, that is rough for Annie. The staggering amount of pain she's gone through in her life all for one thing that's probably as good as dead now. Unless maybe the Liberian Eldians got out? They did know the Rumbling was coming, so I suppose it's possible they could have led a revolt and flown the coop with Marley's military in such a sad state.\n","\n","Just one more fight, Annie. Really liked her trying to reconcile with Mikasa.\n","\n","So I guess next week is the technical series finale, before the assumed movie. Feels surreal to think this is coming to an end. Attack on Titan is a large part of what got me into anime, and it's become probably my favorite work of fiction.\n","399: \t Wow, for the whole episode Eren stepped like 10 steps, lol.\n","\n","I am 100% convinced that Mikasa is NOT bound to Eren, at least not because of her Ackermann status.\n","\n","1) When her powers awakened, Eren was just a regular boy - he hadn't yet gotten any titan powers, so he definitely wasn't her 'king'. \n","\n","2) Levi bashed Erens face over and over and over again, and he's an Ackermann. Shouldn't it work on him as well? \n","\n","I did not expect Falco to say his feelings towards Gabi. That was refreshing. Gabi finally wrapping her head around the propoganda, that she was taught upon, was satisfying. She really is Eren 2.0. \n","\n","I love that it's not a one sided fight and Marley is definitely putting one up. They have their own expertise, their own training and it shows. \n","\n","Just like with almost everything in the show, I don't think I've ever heard Eren, or even a titan, scream inside the titan & make sounds outside. It makes sense, but I don't think it was ever shown. \n","\n","Wow. Another week to wait. Kind of a slow episode, but next week should be better, since Eren will step another 5 steps or so I would think, lol.\n","\n","Also, wtf was that Yelena face for.\n","402: \t Am I the only one getting annoyed by armin. He is going to convince connie to not help her mother return to her human self just to may be reconcile with the cart and Annie.\n","405: \t Episode solved quite a few MIAs.  Nice to have confirmation that Annie heard what was being told to her.  I wonder if she's just short or she didn't grow in that time.  I sorta expected Hitch to hug her but I guess they aren't close that way.  Wonder what she'll do, she wants to return to her father but he'll likely be dead before she gets to him from her view.  Since they didn't explicitly show it, I bet he didn't get shot by that guard and instead used some of his old martial arts skills to take him down.  \n","\n","Also nice to see all of Pieck, Magath, Hange and Levi alive and all together.  I'm guessing, they get to Connie/Falco first and stop them.\n","411: \t I think the biggest thing in this episode for me is that we finally get to see the origins of Eldia. It was always a toss-up because we didn't know which narrative to trust, which version of Eldian history was correct, whether it was the Restorationists' or Marley's.\n","\n","The Marleyans strictly believed that Eldia were tyrants who ruled over the world, waged countless wars and slaughtered innocent people without mercy. Contrarily, the Restorationists believed that Eldia did nothing but help the world, using the power of the Titans to build bridges, roads and cultivate the wastelands.\n","\n","What we see though is a mix of those two stories, with both being partially true. Ymir Fritz wasn't even technically Eldian. She was a slave, under duress to use the power of the Titans to expand the Eldian empire. She did build bridges and roads and advanced the Eldian empire, but she also used her power to completely subdue Marley and kill presumably thousands of Marleyan soldiers.\n","\n","I think it says a lot as a real life parallel to our history, that no one account of historical events can truly be accurate as they seem and that there's always more than one side of the story.\n","\n","It's like Winston Churchill said: \"History is written by the victors.\"\n","414: \t Ymir’s entire backstory is shown. She was a slave for eternity to the ones in power. The origination of the titans is displayed as a strange spinal creature that manifests in humans. Eren challenged the idea of being a slave to the royal bloodline and saved Ymir from eternal slavery thus gaining the true founding powers and declaring the annihilation of the rest of the world. We finally see Erens true intentions right from the start of the show: to save Paradis island. Millions of colossal titans are released and Eren is a huge Titan. He telepathically talks to all subjects of Ymir revealing his plan.\n","\n","Did I miss anything?\n","418: \t Man, this episode was tough to watch. I could feel the struggle of Connie and Armin oh so well.  \n","\n","\n","Unrelated, but I do hope to see more sword action ODM though. Feels like everyone is just using thunder spear besides Mikasa.\n","419: \t This episode is good compared to the last 5 episodes. Those episodes feels slow and rushed at a same time. \n","\n","Final season part 2 episode 5 was a peak fiction. Toping that is really tough.\n","\n","Warriors Titan fight and ODM gear scenes are amazing. Falco jaw titan is cool.\n","\n","Shadis took a train by himself! Magath and Shadis sacrifice feels unnecessary imo. \n","\n","Omg Floch! That was a good death.\n","\n","No stakes in the fight anyway. Yagerists were not threatening. They are canon fodders for Mikasa and warriors. \n","\n","If Levi was healthy, he would solo these guys with no difficulty.\n","421: \t Man I really like the parallels between Mikasa and Louise in these episodes. Gives Mikasa a good chance to see her bad relationship with eren from erens point of view. Also a view into what would have happened to mikasa if she wasn’t an op ackerman, aka died much sooner in the story, probably right away in fact.\n","423: \t So global genocide is erens final plan, and now that he’s some bone creature that’s even taller than the colossal titan, he can carry that plan out. Anyone else kinda feel bad for the eldians not on paradise, seems like there gonna be caught in the crossfire between the world and a colossal titans foot.\n","436: \t Wait a min, the more I think about this episode the crazier it gets. So when Zeke pulled a UNO reverse on Eren using Ymir in the paths, did Eren know that too. Probably yes, this just means everything happening right now is part of Eren's plan. FUCKING LEGEND\n","437: \t This honestly might be one of my favorite episodes of Attack on Titan. Holy shit.\n","\n","* We finally know why the original owl was able to see Eren's memories before Eren was born. It's a power specific to the Attack Titan. I was never sure if it was something all the smart Titans could do, but now we know that the Attack Titan is the only one that can see the memories of future inheritors. \n","\n","* Eren and Zeke traveling Grisha's memories was fucking amazing and so emotionally resonating. Especially those moments when it appeared Grisha and even kid Eren could see both Eren and Zeke. I love this kind of shit so much. It's exactly the kind of story telling that I dig.\n","\n","* HOLY SHIT! Grisha was not going to kill the Reiss family, but Eren was actually able to speak to him and convince him too. Eren could actually effect the past?! So they weren't just traveling through memories. It was really more of a kind of quasi-time travel? or was it more like at that time Grisha was seeing Eren's memories of standing right next to him and speaking to him. So he was able to \"hear\" Eren that way? Either way, Grisha heard Eren and got him to kill the Reiss family.\n","\n","* Grisha and Zeke hugging, damn. So many emotionally resonating moments. And Grisha can see Eren's memories and it sounds like Eren is about to do some mega fucked up shit?!\n","\n","God I fucking love this show.\n","450: \t I started clapping when Shadis showed up and when Gabbi saved Kaya. Such a hype episode. Goddamn though I keep waiting for Hange and Levi to show up again\n","458: \t HOLY FUCK\n","\n","EREN\n","\n","IS\n","\n","RUTHLESS. \n","\n","UNO REVERSE CARD. \n","\n","I love, LOVE how everyone's worldview is being shattered. First there's Gabi, with how Paradis people aren't devils and they're just human, like everyone else. Then, Colt asking Zeke to not hurt Falco, because Zeke would never endanger a childs life, right..? And then Zeke.. with Grisha turning out to not be a bad father, but a loving one that's just human and made mistakes.\n","\n","I fucking love this end boss Eren. If it's a battle of mental fortitude, Eren has lived through hell. Zeke's life might've been hard and full of pain, but Eren was in literal hell. \n","\n","I fucking love this. Eren interfering with Grisha, mind-fucking him, moving forward. Just what will Eren do? If he sees what happens in the future, then he must know how it will all go..\n","\n","Holy shit, this is just. Isayama, you're a genius.\n","\n","EDIT: So wait, when he kissed Historia's hand, was it then that he transferred the memories towards Grisha? Or was it todays thing? Because it would make sense if he did that during Historia's hand, because he didn't know what he was doing and he was unguided. \n","\n","I'll repeat myself again. Eren is ruthless. He will destroy everything in order to live free. Even brainfuck his father. No sympathy. Only moving forwards. What a character.\n","460: \t Wow Poor Pixis I was bawling. Gabi saving Maya was beautiful and Shadis saving those worthless recruits was awesome.\n","466: \t So uhh, I wonder what Levi thought about this partnership with Marley…must be strange for him to be that close to Annie knowing she killed all those Scouts\n","468: \t I have a wild theory. Do the attack titan shifters follow their own path/will specifically because of the future memories they get to see? And are all of them manipulated by Eren to specifically do what is needed for the titan to eventually pass down to him. Imagine Eren manipulating 100 years of shifters or even 2000 years to give rise to these specific scenarios. Could it also be that since attack titan was a part of the original founding titan (ymir) Eren could also feed memories to her? I mean if not manipulation he could have a conversation with her by looking into her memories and feeding those memories back to her the same way they were able to take to grisha.\n","471: \t -This episode was amazing, Armin's and Connie's confrontation with Samuel and Daz is why I love this show, world is cruel, nobody is right and nobody is wrong, everyone has their reasons and everyone has blood on their hands, this is just amazing and at the same painful to witness.\n","-AoT is one of these shows that makes 20 minutes feel like 5 and at the same time making you feel like not that much happened but really important stuff actually happens, idk how to put it, it's like a weird paradox\n","-Also MAPPA's Female Titan looks great, it's a lot more similar to Annie and seems more expressive which makes it easier to associate the titan with the shifter, before the titan kinda looked like Annie but it was kinda tricky to fully grasp that she and the Female Titan are one and the same, obviously I knew it was her but my mind didn't really make a clear connection, I know this sounds kinda stupid, what I mean is: it's good that the Female Titan looks more like Annie now.\n","473: \t This episode was more eventful than last weeks episode, but very rushed. Like Annie joining Mikasa and the rest so quickly without even exchanging any words? Mikasa literally chopped Annie's titan fingers off and made her plummet down the wall in season 1 with the intention to kill her right before she crystalized before getting eaten by Eren. Im excited for next weeks episode but i want to see more development and relevant and interesting explanations.\n","\n","Also, Falco's voice makes me feel like the demonslayer season never ended yet (same with Connie's voice).\n","475: \t I still can't help but believe Eren will get his way somehow.  No idea how he's going to get out of the shit situation he is in right now though... living in a millisecond of time with his head shot off and even in the other world he's getting fucked up by Zeke.  Zeke did mention that he wants to save the world and have Eren in it though.  He also said Ymir could create anything so i'm betting she saves Eren somehow.\n","\n","All the shifters can sense when the founder is being used.  So I'm betting this is what wakes Annie up and she awakens alone in her underground cell.  OP shows her sitting in a dark room looking as if she is adjusting to finally waking up.\n","478: \t I like that Jean thought the old version of himself was repulsive when Floch brought it up. I also like that he fuckin hates Floch's guts.\n","480: \t The action continues!!! And it's a bloody massacre!\n","\n","The quality just jumped off the roof again with some pretty sweet shots and details.\n","\n","Onto the story. The decision not to get the flying ship working here and go straight for Eren because it would take too long. The Hizuru knows a place they could setup the flying machine faster but they need to drag it with a ship there. The sacrifice is that the colossal titans are already at the coast and they will get quite far even with this method.. And I'm wondering yet again... Even if they get the ship working at the new port and get to Eren... Yeah I don't think it will be over just like that.\n","\n","The Jaegerists got beaten hard but I was quite surprised what damage they were able to inflict. Both Reiner and especially Annie absolutely blown up almost like Eren back at the city. Marleyan general... Wearing Scouts jacket.. It's a disgrace!!! Haha jk. Looking good. Oh and the first time we see Falco in his Jaw titan form. As expected he can't control it but nice damage haha. Very tense fight. The amount of thunder spear attacks the Jaegerists did.. Record high. But they couldn't get a single shot on the boat, thanks to Reiner's Armor and Annie too. And daamn. Mikasa getting those sweet 3DMG shots. That moment where she stabs through two jeagerist fighters, and launches one of their thunder spear. Then the sweet walk away.. And the blood just rains on top... I can't :D :D...\n","\n","One moment that really made me think \"somebody gonna bite the bullet\" at the moment where Floch fully enraged about to launch the thunder spear at the ship and I was like please Connie don't jump in front of that... Phew. Haha he misses the shot coz Gabbi with her sniper sense blasts his shoulder at the last moment.\n","\n","Gotta give credit to Shadis too.. Dude sabotaged the Jaegerist support train that would have ended this dark horse mission of save the world. Oh and he and the Marleyan general Magath. Sacrifice themselves to blow a Jaegerist ship that would have trailed them.\n","\n","I don't usually watch \"after ending song\" as they usually just spoil and tease what happens on next episode. But this time there was a moment where Annie just breaks down. That was quite wholesome actually. Shows the light side of Annie. So she knows she herself don't have the goal which was to save her father figure but now that it is confirmed that they don't have time to save him.. Yeah. She actually confesses that she doesn't want to kill.. Even Eren.\n","\n","Overall another great back to back with even more action. I will give this one a 8.5/10. I really did enjoy this one.\n","482: \t i forgot this was attack on titan, i expected smooth sailing to the end of the show with eren tricking zeke......also rip pixis, died fighting for eldia as he always had\n","490: \t Guys, any ideas on why Eren shouted “Wait!” before Colt did (when Zeke was about to scream)?\n","493: \t What a fucking amazing episode. The action was so sick. Mikasa gliding around destroying everyone is so fun to watch. The blank stare at us with blood on her face. Chills.  The Shadis/Magath send off was so beautiful, when the music hit and the it switched to the scene of the ship blowing up. Just beautiful.\n","494: \t Today's episode made no sense to me. Why are Mikasa, armin and connie supporting Marley? For the first 3 and a half seasons they fought for their freedom against marley and now that eren's about to give them freedom they're like lets change team. Wtf? Also they find Annie and they're just like... hey annie?? This woman killed so many of your friends and now they're just like that's okay? Their reaction to annie just makes no fucking sense. This is the same person who murdered petra and so many others. But they're reunion was like theyre old classmates or something. This episode just made no sense to me.\n","495: \t Wait, Reiner's hardening is the same as Annie's and the wall's? \n","\n","If Eren can undo that, why can't he undo someone who is already a pure titan?\n","499: \t [Rare footage of Isayama's plot armor in action.](https://imgur.com/a/WvZHkXn) Now we know how he manages to keep Reiner alive after everything he's been through. \n","\n","But for real, I guess this is supposed to be Ymir Fritz? And titans' regenerative abilities are actually just this poor girl slaving away in the sands of time. I also noticed Zeke's shadow looks strange and it doesn't seem to be the shape of the Beast Titan, either.\n","500: \t Who has a screenshot of Jean waking up Reiner after caving his face in? I’ve never seen a man so done and ready to die.\n","503: \t Amazing episode.  I like how they showed that Grisha was never really as bad a guy as they painted him out to be.  Zeke is now questioning his hate for him, and it seems many of the horrible things he had done were a result of Eren somewhat commanding him to do so.  Grisha has seen the future that Eren will bring and he thinks it's awful, I wonder what he will do... My assumption is that Eren sees the whole world as enemies.  He said he would kill all his enemies and that all there is on the other side of the sea are more enemies.  So I think he will use the rumbling not just to defend Paradis but to actually kill everyone and succeed.  As far as we know, the future set by the Attack Titan cannot be changed, since Grisha saw all of that and still was compelled to give the Attack and Founding titans to Eren immediately after murdering the Reiss family.\n","\n","All attack titans from the beginning until now have been working towards some sort of future and this is why they 'keep moving forward'.  Seems like next episode will go back to the original set of titans and we'll see what sort of motivation they'd have for wanting everyone dead.\n","507: \t If ymir lost the will to live i think she took that spear on purpose, so she can end her life of slavery, i mean I don't think she shielded the king out of love\n","508: \t Annie was so annoying this episode! Losing the big picture and just wanting to save her dad! Others are a fighting to save something larger than their interests (Reiner for next gen; Jean, Connie, Hange, Armin for the world; Magath for his country). Shut the fuck up bitch…you have been out for 4 years and sound like a toddler in front of others. \n","\n","The pain the scouts must be feeling is unfathomable! When will they get some rest?\n","510: \t Definitely my favourite of the second half of this season. I mean… of this half of this third of this final season? This series really needs to be less liberal with its use of the phrase “final season” lmao\n","\n","ANYWAY SOME THOUGHTS \n","\n","1) first and foremost pour one out for Keith CHADis and Theo -Magnum dong- Magath. I have a soft spot for “the strict teacher but are ride or die for the pupils” archetype so seeing them take the fall for scouts/warriors respectively was simultaneously kickass and heartbreaking. More so for Shadis cause NO ONE EVEN KNOWS HE WAS THERE.\n","\n","2)Damn Thunderspears really were a fucking game changer and I never really thought about that until I seen them making MINCEMEAT out of Annie and Reiner, the biggest threat of Season 1. Crazy to think even if no one ever discovered Eren and Titanshifting, and the warriors never infiltrated the walls, the scouts probably would have started to push back the titans and get outside the walls in a matter of years anyway \n","\n","3) Another thing that Shadis death said to me at least is, that’s IT for reinforcements. The Alliance is out to sea, Historia, Hitch and anyone else are stuck in Paradis. Every single person who can stop Eren is on that Ship.\n","\n","4) Cool to Finally see Falcos Jaw Titan. It’s almost funny how many different holders we’ve seen of that one. Like Annie Reiner and Pieck are the only Cart Female and Armour we’ve seen, we only saw previous Attack Founder and Beast Titans in Flashbacks and Armin inheriting the Colossal was a huge deal but the Jaw is just like “new season new me :)” lmao\n","\n","5) Damn Gabi finally using her crackshot, sharpshooter abilities on a main character that gets rapturous applause, you love to see it.\n","\n","6) Flochs…. definitely dead right? Like he got shot and fell into ocean that’s pretty open and shut right? The fact they drew so little attention to it makes me slightly suspicious lmao\n","\n","7) Good if terrifying to have Hange break down the pace that Rumbling is going at. 4 days to stop Eren or he wipes out a CONTINENT. That’s …efficient\n","511: \t NOTE: I am theorizing really hard in this post, I have not read the manga and have no future knowledge of the plot line. This could all be wrong.\n","\n","My theory is, what if the Attack titan only has the future memory ability because of Eren? As far as we know only Grisha and Eren have had control of the Attack titan AND the Founding titan and Grisha didn't possess both for very long until passing it to Eren.\n","\n","In addition, this place that Eren and Zeke are currently in, where time has no meaning with access to the paths (To you, in 2000 years. Mind blowing.), would allow Eren to place all those memories in past holders of the Attack titan. For all we know it may only be Kruger, Grisha and Eren himself that he has shown future memories to, (S4E1) >!although at the beginning of S4 Falco seems to be having some kind of titan memory but was not yet a titan!<. Kruger seemed surprised to have a vision of the future when he mentioned saving Armin and Mikasa, that literally could have been the only time Kruger experienced a future memory.\n","\n","This is pure speculation, I think Eren is going to steal Zeke's body. Or try to, maybe Zeke can stop him. That way it will be Eren's soul, w/ each of the titans he possesses, inside a body with royal blood. Maybe that idea is a little crazy but that way he will have complete control of the Founding titan's abilities.\n","\n","It makes me a little sad, I don't want Eren to go off the rails and go bad. But I guess there's still hope that Eren's plan is for the good. Grisha telling Zeke that his glimpse of the future looks terrible and begging Zeke to stop Eren might be a misunderstanding or Eren intentionally showing something to Grisha to put Zeke off balance.\n","\n","This episode was fantastic, easily my favorite of season 4 and honestly it might be up there with my favorites of the entire series. I was so happy that Zeke finally got to see his father the way we the viewers have seen him, as a good man. A man that loved his son Zeke and regretted he wasn't a better father to him.\n","512: \t Remember back in part 1\n","\n","\n","Magath's boss asked, \"Do you have any titan that flies? \"\n","\n","\n","Was that a foreshadow? 🙂\n","\n","\n","There is a clear bird theme going on with Falco, his name, him waking up watching a bird in episode 1, and now becoming a titan with beak and bird lile claws\n","\n","\n","Will he also fly 🙂🙂🙂\n","513: \t Absolutely loved the scenes with Armin, Connie, and the two Yeagerists. The tension when they're pretending to be on the same side was insane, and the moment Connie decides to kill them made my jaw drop. \r  \n","\r  \n","Imagine being told back in season 1 that we'd be cheering for the Armor and Female Titans vs a bunch of scouts.\n","516: \t I shivered when Grisha pleaded Zeke to stop Eren, like holy shit I can just feel Zeke's terror from witnessing Eren's true colors!\n","517: \t Absolutely no relief from the weight of things this episode.\n","\n","Starting off with Connie and Armin's pain was rough enough emotionally, but the entire action sequence had me torn between hype for the action and agony for the result. It's just so messed up seeing Mikasa have to kill her emotions again to be able to get through this, for so much blood to be spilt on both sides that the harbor turned red, and all out of desperation that the innocents won't die. Every episode I like the ED more and more because it just caps off the mood from these sorts of episodes perfectly without being a complete downer.\n","\n","As far as the technical side of the animation, the ODM sequence may lack the smoothness of the previous seasons, but I love how far they took the dynamic camera especially with the segments with Floch and Mikasa. The sound effects for this episode are also some of the best we've had so far I think, the sound breaking through Connie's shock, the blasts and flesh from the Titans, the footsteps on the boat. Just really well done overall.\n","\n","And Floch's still not fucking dead! FUCKING WHY. I don't believe for a second he's dead until we see his bloody floating corpse.\n","518: \t Why am I still holding out hope that Eren has not become the bringer of death for the rest of the world? I feel like Armin.\n","  \n","He has the full power of the founding Titan, and is not bound by the will of King Fritz. Eren's will seems to even be strong enough to elicit an emotional response from Ymir, who appears otherwise hollow from her experiences. Could Eren really be setting out to destroy all other humans aside from the subjects of Ymir? Surely he can see how that is only perpetuating the cycle of violence and oppression. If the founder Ymir was the one who reached through the path to Eren over 2000 years, then I can only hope she saw good in Eren and the ability to end the conflict.\n","  \n","I can't see this tale ending without one thing though -- the complete elimination of all titans. Whatever entity bound itself to Ymir is the source, and we still don't know what it's motivation is, if any. I can't wait to see how this all wraps up.\n","521: \t Imagine with how \"slow\" some transformations are like the colossal titan just how long it probably takes Ymir to build them with just sand and a water bucket, holy shit, probably in the thousands of years.\n","523: \t People are saying Annie’s pie scene is out of place  or whatever but I feel like Annie has always been out of place in this show. She’s simultaneously a cold capable killer that also shows regret that also plays with scouts dead bodies and I feel like she’s never really been as fleshed out as she should of. I think the reason I feel weird abt her is cause we see bertholdt and Reiner come to terms with their actions and face consequences while Annie kind of just exists. Anyone else feel the same?\n","529: \t Damn who’s ready for some more of the female titan, it’s been a while and she looks amazing in this episodes. Also love the little bit of team work between Reiner and Annie since we never really got to see them fight as titans together before\n","530: \t WHAT!?!? Holy shit my jaw is on the floor. This is show is unreal. Still so many questions. So looks like ymirs daughters are the same name as the walls. And so she wants to be freed from being a slave, but I’m wondering how she was signaling that to eren.\n","533: \t Bruh Eren did it again the rest of the island about to be either stomped by the colossals or eaten by the Zeke titans. Hope they address the rest of the people on paradis but they probably won't.\n","535: \t Just rewatched the episode where Grisha talks to Kruger on the wall. He said the exact same words Eren said to him now ... about his sister and how \"This is a story you began, is it not?\"  \n","\n","He also says \"To save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else, you must see it through\", so Eren was guiding him too.\n","\n","What a masterful story. I've got chills.\n","536: \t Idk if anyone has already said it, but when they got that close up shot of Eren's eyes in the cave as he glared at Grisha's back, they chose a very interesting sound effect. Sort of like a...rumbling.\n","541: \t Insane how thick the allies plot armour is. They're just able to slash through anything while the Yeagerists miss every shot and stand there afk. Awful.\n"," \n","But animation good therefore 10/10 🤡\n","542: \t That was such a harrowing episode. Ymir is such a tragic character, King Fritz is a pos as expected. When Eren said he’d free her it was chilling, the attack titan fights for freedom and Ymir deserves it.\n","\n","Eren is insane. To think he’s been controlling everything from the start and has now set off to destroy the rest of the world.\n","\n","I have so many questions. Is Zeke still alive and if so what will he do? Are Armin and Mikasa or any of the og Scouts going to help Eren in his plan? What are the Warriors going to do? Where are Levi and Hange?!\n","549: \t Why are l all Eldians subjects of Ymir/able to titan shift?\n","\n","Ymir was Eldian, we saw her race/people/village. She became a titan and had offspring with the King, but I'm assuming her other people, the ones in the village, whom don't have titan blood also had children and offspring and are also Eldian. So why do all Eldians have the ability to titan shift?\n","552: \t There be a lot of walking this episode.\n","\n"," Can't say I really liked this episode as it felt like a lot of scenes at the start being very drawn out (those scenes in the stairs were bizarrely edited and felt very padded).\n","\n"," There was also a lot of dumb shit. They made a big deal of Eren losing motor control but gains it back quickly but can't heal his limp quickly. Zeke didn't bother jumping down after eliminating the threat of Reiner and Porco (also Porco getting thrown off and saying it was a weighty attack despite it not feeling it). And why are you bringing Falco closer to Zeke. Even if you believe Zeke cares enough about Falco to not turn him into a Titan, why risk it especially with there being a chance Zeke turns him into a Titan prior to them warning him\n","556: \t Alright ill say it: Low-key shipping Frieda and Zeke lmao\n","\n","Frieda: Life is terrible and we should all die\n","\n","Zeke: Damn she just like me fr\n","557: \t Once Ymir died, and her children ate her I’m assuming the children became the first Titan shifters. But how did the pure mindless titans start appearing? Did King Fritz, in his vow to keep Eldia confined within the walls just make up the threat of the pure titans, and then ordered the founder to create pure titans outside the walls?\n","558: \t 1.\tMarco has been dead since early season 1 and he still affects some of the characters to this day.\r  \n","2.\tHere we go; this will probably be the final set up episode until the climatic finish (or at the very least, an exciting three parter to end this season on a cliffhanger). \r  \n","Excited to see the character interactions (and wow there are alot of them) around the fire side.\r  \n","3.\tAlso, no opening theme song because the RUMBLING is not COMING anymore, it's already here.\r  \n","4.\tEven Yelena stans potato girl (who also killed people btw, so perhaps it's not genuine considering the context of the conversation). Also, Falco is the only purely innocent one there; everyone there better protect him at all costs.\r  \n","5.\tThe trajectory of Gabi's character/ her development has been phenomenal.\r  \n","6.\t\"You guys are so loud\" Levi, never change.\r  \n","7.\tThe way Jean woke Reiner up was pretty rude, but I bet Reiner appreciated that FAR more than how Annie woke him up in the last episode.\r  \n","8.\tWell that was a serviceable episode, but I can't lie and say I'm not disappointed there wasn't more interactions between the characters, particularly Annie with the rest. \r  \n","9.\tAnyways, I think this is how it'll go: Next 3 episodes will be fighting against the Yeagerists and Floch, and the final movie /whatever will be against Eren as the endgame boss.\n","561: \t It seems like every main character is just straight up broken. Reiner has been unhinged for years now, Zeke's lost it, Eren might've just been completely played by Zeke, Gabbi is distraught, Porco went full suicide, Falco will probably have extreme PTSD. I feel like this entire season has just been showing the cycle of hatred and violence that happens with war like this.\n","564: \t Eren can control, see, change the future because of his Attack titan ability, founding titan and interaction with royal blood member(Zeke), but my question is how he do that? Ymir choose Eren even though he haven't existed yet?\n","568: \t The violence treatment in this episode was brutal. Killing a bunch of guys with you titan kick with giant foot or just close your hand and explode the corpses, with no remorse, without any hesitation, a pure death spectacle, that become much more dark with the contrast that the dock scene provides. Some deaths didn't meant nothing, other, are just too much to handle.\n","569: \t Finally an episode that lets me at least relax in terms being hyped all the time lol. I am glad Gabi has gotten a lot of development, but I just will never like her. She killed Sasha and even a few episodes back when she sniped Eren made me mad (although she was in the right after seeing what he has become lol).\n","\n","Seeing Connie down bad like this is also very sad :(\n","\n","AND YESSSS. Time for Annie! I have missed her!\n","576: \t yoo, what was the rifle that Gabi used? Looks like Barret m82. It's actually the first time that I saw a weapon in like that in aot\n","578: \t Is it me or Reiner stood absolutely no chance fighting Eren 1v1 at this point? Eren dumpstered Reiner like nothing if not for Galliard and Pieck interfering.\n","579: \t Oh no, the one thing I feared the most is happening..\n","\n","The main characters are waging war on Eren. I fucking hate this. I don't want our main characters to fight Eren. \n","\n","I genuenly thought Jean would shoot Floch, but seems like things are moving in the shadows.\n","\n","Annie being there, randomly, is quite hilarious lol. \n","\n","I hope next episode we finally get to see Eren. I still haven't seen what the fuck is the founding titan form and I want to know how Eren is doing.\n","585: \t Who ever shot the arrow at young Ymir is probably punching the air rn, shoulda aimed for the head smh\n","590: \t Quick question: so ymir sets the pigs free and the king looking guy says \"you're free\", then next scene she's being hunted by some soldiers (the same king's soldiers?). Then she gets the titan powers and all that. After this, why does she go back to the king and serve him? Didn't he fuck her over?\n","592: \t Holyyy shiet!!!\n","\n","Damn that intro just blasts with that chaos lol.\n","\n","But damn!!! This episode.\n","\n","So many things happened. And the quality.. Like, How they mix the 3D feel but stays anime 2D.. Just amazing..\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","Like I was wondering on my last episode post.. Will Zeke use the shout? and will he get contact with Eren?\n","\n","Exactly both happened. Damn this show is getting crazier and crazier! Eren's titan looking like almost half dead from all the firings from Cart Titan and Reiner + Jaw Titan on top of that...\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","I'm so glad to see and know that all of this. ALL OF THIS, Eren has been playing on Zeke's plan intentionally.\n","\n","Eren trying to convince not hard but like emotionally on Zeke not to use the shout as Falko comes to tell Zeke to not to shout.\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","Zeke trying to sound sympathetic.. But you could see he really didn't give a crap about the people lol.\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","Damn.. Seeing the full block turning into titans... And especially the fellow military police and garrison squads... FeelsBadMan..\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","Fights going everywhere.. Mikasa and Armin distracting cart titan because the incompetent rookies couldn't handle it lol. And damn.. Zeke just controls the newly formed Falko to go and attack on Reiner.. Reiner being like \"Finally inner peace\", but Galliard just coming like \"hey come eat me instead of him\" haha.\n","\n","I guess we are getting Falko back then \\^\\^\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","So after that Eren distracts Cart Titan and Reiner by escaping from his titan form and running towards Zeke..\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","And damn this moment I did not expect... Gabbi.. This damned kid that has done some miracle stuff since the damn Part 1...\n","\n","Shoots Eren while he is running straight trough neck and his damn head flies 5 meters up...\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","I have not had a mouth drop for a loong time.. lol.\n","\n","Just absolutely perfection of quality Mappa made that shot though.. The 3D all around how the time stopped and it felt like it took like 1 minute that one single moment.\n","\n","I had it in mind. \"Damn he dead\"\n","\n","And in the end the head lands on Zeke's hand :D\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","Oh yes.. Then comes the I guess \"Heaven dimension\" where Zeke is chained. And they show the full ending of one of the flashbacks that was in season 4 Part 1 where they make it sound like Eren accepted the euthanasia of Eldians.\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","You see instead of Eren catching the ball from Zeke he misses it and I interpreted it as rejection.\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","And yes the old Eren as I have been missing from all this last season... Comes to light. Just straight up says he played Zeke all the time.\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","Honestly I didn't expect Eren to be this type of \"clever, I'm one step ahead of you\" type of person but I guess if he wanted to move forward he had to play like this. I always remember Eren just being this humble man in Season 1 and 2 of just taking all the burden and going head first for the fights \\^\\^\n","\n","I mean it felt to me so obvious on Part 1 that Eren was so different...\n","\n","And that felt so good when Eren said the Zeke's euthanasia plan is full of shit!\n","\n","THAT IS THE EREN I KNOW! LET'S GOOO!\n","\n","But I was already at that point WRAPPING UP this episode...\n","\n","But the damn uno reverse from ZEKE...\n","\n","HE PLAYED EREN BY DAMN CHAINING HIMSELF INTENTIONALLY TOO HAHAHAHA.\n","\n","How more ANIME CAN THIS BE?\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","All chaos aside. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS EPISODE!\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","I'm gonna be honest. I didn't have a lot of hope for this part 2 as I had so bad experience watching the part 1.\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","But I can see now.. With small steps.. We are getting back this feeling of true Attack on Titan (I mean at least I'm getting these Season 1 and 2 vibes \\^\\^)\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","I give this episode 8.5/10 . So many good feelings and the quality as expected from Mappa delivers very well. Especially when it comes to gore and the fights.\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","I still personally don't like how the characters look on this last season but ey maybe they can change too as this goes \\^\\^\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","Can't wait for next week already <3\n","593: \t But how could Grisha hug Zeke? I understand that he can see him through Eren's memories, but how can he touch him physically?\n","596: \t Eren is crazy, kicking off his own origin story. \n","\n","So someone tell me if i'm wrong but as I understand it, young eren was able to know what is happening now because grisha has memories of being contacted by old eren, and old eren is able to contact grisha because zeeke has taken him back with the power of the founder? This all seeming to have been triggered with the hand kiss. So eren put his plan into motion to get to this point (or maybe he had the entire sequence of events laid out for him and he just followed along, this seems less likely to me based on times he's been surprised and caught off guard since the time skip). Some are saying that eren is the last attack titan which i also believe to be true but he could possibly know way more about the future anyway depending on what his future self has shared with grisha right? So eren potentially knows whats coming, wow this show is amazinf.\n","599: \t THIS WAS AN EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER JESUS \n","- Kaya almost getting eaten by Nile, Niccolo stopping Mr. Blouse and Gabi channeling Sasha: ALMOST CRIED\n","- Shadis leading the remaining soldiers: SCREAMED\n","- Armin saying his last farewell to Pyxis: FEELING FEELINGS I CAN'T EXPLAIN\n","603: \t Eren planned this all for so long and suffered so much just to get there, and he couldn't wait a few seconds to test if Ymir listens to him, before revealing to Zeke that's he isn't going with the euthanasia plan ?\n","\n","I literally expected him not to respond to Zeke at all and just slowly walk over to Ymir.\n","610: \t Zeke Surely is an impressive warrior in war, he changed tides within seconds that It's almost unfair and shows true powers of the titans. Also can they stop making 5 min episodes please :(   \n","and that Yelena face did look straight outta JJBA\n","611: \t The saddest thing is that, while Magath may have died, nobody knows that Shadis is dead because he didnt show himself, but only to Magath, fuck this shit is sad\n","614: \t I can't blame Connie for doing it, because in the heat of the moment you don't have time to think it through and the only correct decision you can make is to actually make a choice and go through with it *right fucking now*. But man, I don't think Samuel had to die.\n","619: \t If levi is dead I'm improvising my own thunderspear and taking myself out\n","620: \t No one knows that Keith Shadis saved the alliance, the only person that knew died with him. He truly remained a bystander till the end...\n","624: \t Poor Armin. To come so far, to have been so right and so wrong about Eren and end up deciding he should have just died. That hits right into my heart because it's an impossible situation to look back on. I wonder if this will reignite the old debates again?\n","\n","He makes an interesting comparison with Floch. Floch thinks that surviving Shiganshina gave him the right to be free at any cost, that their survival alone meant they earnt everyone elses respect and obedience. Armin looks back on his survival as something he has to earn, he has to live up to in order to make it worth it over everyone elses.\n","\n","Floch idealizes Eren because he needs someone to follow and it always seemed like Eren had the right plan, but that's exactly what people were doing to Erwin. Even when he was unsure, he was never allowed to step down from being the leader, the person who knew, and that's created an almost mythical sense of the man in everyone elses minds, for better or worse. Armin looks at his memories of Erwin leading and thinks \"he always knew what to do\" and because he has doubts and shows it, because he doesn't know how to lead even though he knows how to plan when he's really pushed, he doesn't think he could ever compare to the person in his memories. He needs Levi there to tell him who Erwin really was as a person and give him the same talk he once gave Eren, to take the life you have and make your choices and not regret, though hopefully with less devastating consequences\n","\n","Nice to see that Pieck and Levi both survived as well, one looking remarkably better than the other, though I'm quite surprised that Pieck managed to shield Magath through those walls collapsing. Don't have much of a comment on Annie though, mostly what we knew from the OVA, though it was funny to see the revision on the setting for that with the new canon about what's outside the walls, and I'll be very interested to see who she ends up running into first.\n","641: \t Camera movement on Floch's jump was strange. He flied so much high in the sky after bursting out of the window.\n","643: \t Am I the only who thinks  the story is being rushed to its end? The pacing of this episode is just crazy! just a few hours ago they were in a state of confusion as to how to deal with Eren's plan. And now suddenly Marlians and anti-yeagerists  (for lack of a better word) joined hands with each other to stop the rumbling. I feel the transition was not adequately explained. How the heck did Jean agree to help Marley while all their soldiers were out of Shiganshina since Eren unleashed the wall titans?\n","644: \t I finally understand why so many of you like Magath.\n","\n","He's shown real character this episode humbling himself before the people he perceived as devils and recognising that's he's been avoiding introspection about the entire conflict between Marley and Paradis.\n","646: \t I am thoroughly confused and perhaps in the future episodes this got explained. \n","\n","So a primordial symbiotic creature bonded to Ymir and made her the 'host'. Is it sentient? Is all along Ymir, who apparently may not have Eldian blood even, just a willing  host?  Is this how the creature procreate pretty much? So the goal is to infect a host, defends it when there's an impending doom (by titan transformation) ? \n","\n","What exactly killed her? Why then? Was that the spot the creature actually physically manifested on (between the brain and the spine) ? She's murdered while being a human, no transformation then.\n","\n","The first \"passing on \" ritual was then through literal human consumption, but how did that transfer mechanic evolves into what we have known ever since? Why only Eldian? I thought originally it is genetics (identifiable by blood) but if that's how one got exposed then not really?\n","\n","I hope this got explained more. It is fascinating and I am happy it is more sci-fi than being pure fantastical.\n","651: \t Honestly I don't even blame Connie for taking Falco to get eaten, poor guy he's already lost the rest of his family + Sasha. \n","\n","Even though I don't think he will go through with it (Let's be real Connie's mom isn't going to somehow end up as a character this late), I still just feel bad for him and don't begrudge him\n","654: \t Ok. Ima go off here:  I'm so mad at this episode. I was mad the previous episode because it felt like the yeagerist were kinda nerfed and were being decimated a little too easy but i accepted it as a surprise attack and people getting wrecked. In this episode however it's just too much. the Yeagerist are an absolute joke. The Yeagerists had numbers, thunder spears, odm gear, pistols and rifles. how did they get wrecked so badly! I know the Yeagerist are supposed to be the \"bad guys\" but they are straight up idiots now. Missing every shot? Not firing their thunder spears from a safer distance or just holding on to them and not firing them at the titans. the reinforcement train being conveniently destroyed. everybody getting caught off guard all the time, zero situational awareness. they nerfed the yeagerist so badly in the writing its gone from laughable to actually making me angry. Deus ex machina every five minutes.  I get plot armor but this was so blatant its actually making me hate the story. Attack on titan is known for showing how hopeless a situation can be and by some miracle make it out alive and i was expecting to see that this episode, where the \"stop eren\" crew just barely escape but no. they ABSOLUTLY steam rolled the yeagerist. i though maybe Falco would be the one thing that turns the situation around but they seemed to have it all going their way even without his titan.\n","659: \t Grisha: *raises a son that turns on him and sends him to die*\n","\n","Grisha: “lets try that again”\n","\n","Grisha: *raises a son that turns on him and sends him to die*\n","660: \t My jaw was literally on the floor the entire time\n","\n","THE RUMBLING FINALLY HAPPENED \n","\n","HOLY SHIT\n","663: \t I fcking cried when Keith appeared with the gear in front of the cadets who beat him up, then 'Barricades' started playing.\n","\n","Also when Gabi came in to save Kaya from Nile titan and Kaya saw Sasha. fck 😭😭\n","666: \t This might be a unpopular opinion but did anyone else find this episode hard to watch? Like god damn, so much plot armor on the \"alliance\". In the beginning, you are telling me out of hundreds of Yaegerist, no one managed to launch a single thunder spear at Reiner or Annie? Why did no one else go for the ship after Reiner and Annie were immobilzed? It was literally only Connie and Mikasa fighting after that. Animtation was amazing tho.\n","667: \t As Annie's hardening was undone, armins hardening was...\n","668: \t oh. MY. **GOD**.  \n","After watching it twice, I'll try to recollect my thoughts for this one.\n","\n","**Yuki Kaji**(Eren's voice actor) is **ONE OF THE GREATEST** there is! That scene where Eren screams in chains made me forget I'm watching an anime.\n","\n","**Ymir's past**.   \n","Holy shit.   \n","I can't remember that I felt bad for anyone in the series as I did for Ymir in this episode.   \n","The devil of all earth is just a sperm cell?   \n","What the hell was that thing?????\n","\n","So the walls are named after the daughters of Ymir?   \n","How did they inherit their mom's power if she was already dead?   \n","How did those nine titan shifters came into existence from just one titan?   \n","She really built all those colossal titans and walls all by herself?   \n","I'm at **loss** for words. \n","\n","That scene where the (Path tree?) turns from 3 paths(Maria, Rose, Sina) into multiple signifies the descendants of Ymir(Eldians) or just the number of shifters down the line?\n","\n","So all this time she was waiting for someone to **save** her.   \n","And that someone was **Eren**.   \n","Holy SHIT.\n","\n","That (**sperm cell thing**?), that brought Eren back to life was the power of the Founding Titan?\n","\n","**THE WALLS HAVE COLLAPSED.**   \n","I would've been really suprised about this outcome if the opening wasn't named \"The Rumbling\" but either way the scene where the walls break was so unreal I felt like a part of me broke with those walls.

The people of Paradis island are sceptic about Eren as his controlled titans has destroyed homes and seemed to have killed a damn ton of own people. Annie is back and we get to see some more backstory on her part which is nice. So it now seems to be confirmed that the only the Eldians heared the Eren's attack as Annie's dad figure tried to warn the Marleyan guards about the attack. But he seems to get shot because the guards don't believe him. And it now seems there is no more official scout, garrison and MP brigades as the \"Jaegerists\" have taken fully control of the whole island. This snake Floch. Like literally I have no idea how this one survived from the damn S3 Ape titan's stone bombardment. Then carrying Erwin and trying to get him healed over Armin... And  now he seems to be the head of the damn Jaegerists and is trying to manipulate JEAN!!! Connie chilling and lying on Falco \"Yeaa I will take you to place where you can be cured\". Poor Falco is buying that and like \"Thanks for everything Connie\" lol. BUT DAMN. What am I seeing at the end. LEVI HEICHOU??!! Fight it brother! Good to see him on screen haha.\n","\n","Overall one of those episodes that felt quite quick. Tensions and talking going on, quite chaotic feeling still, some flashback stuff and yea. When Part 3? Haha. I will give this episode solid 7/10. Nothing too bad to say but nothing amazing either.\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","This might be unpopular opinion but hear me out. One thing that has wondereded me during the Mappa era and the last season is the clothes of the fighters... Like.. Almost everyone is dressed up like they are heading to a fancy party or something. Just to name a few. Jean, Armin and Mikasa. Like I get that they don't have to be on the gear all the time but jeez. Put the good old Scout Regiment jacket on haha. Naah no hating. I just think the OG uniform looks 🔥 \\^\\^\n","697: \t This one felt like a very lazy animation episode. Lots of the dialogue shots were cut away from mouths which I found odd, like just a top two thirds head so they don't have to animate a mouth, and Annie covering her mouth from the frame while speaking felt uncharacteristic. And then the really low resolution ground texture near the end, and the people walking around the ports at the end looking like Age of Empires 1 resolution, just pixelated blocks moving around. \n","\n","\n","\n","I guess episodes like this had to take a cut to animate some of the more important ones. Hopefully the best are still coming, but it's still in a post rumbling slowdown and might pick up in the movie.  \n","\n","As far as the story, yeah, we're getting along with starting to tie together both sides, however reluctantly right now. I was still more with Jean's side than Maggath's, half his argument about things so long ago no one here was responsible for, and the other half was about their responses to Marley trying to kill them all. I think that's not just because these are the characters we grew up with, one is inherited sin and the other is what these people themselves did, the rest is how their victims responded.\n","698: \t Surprisingly Eren ripping the skin of his hands was not the most disgusting thing in the episode as the children eating there mum takes it\n","699: \t What the fuuuuuck  \n"," \n","Now that's the way to do a protagonist flip reveal, take notes end of GoT. The imagery of his face on the black screen when he was talking, obviously likening this to a kind of devil. That was DARK.    \n"," \n","Ymir's life is so fucked up. Starts as a slave, may or may not have let loose a pig, takes the blame, falls into a tree, comes into contact with \"Something\", becomes a child concubine to the king forced to bear child after child, and after dying is chopped up and fed to those children. THEN, for reasons I'm not sure are clear (the kings wishes? Did the \"Something\" follow his command?) she's the one to build titans alone for an eternity, every single one a pain staking chore, every time one is formed, for 2000 years, which stretch to eternity where Ymir is, must have been millions of years building titans    \n"," \n","She seems entirely innocent in all this, but this extreme punishment of someone innocent creates a lot of righteous rage, and so she gave Eren the Founding Titan powers, in an amazing segment where it joined his severed head.

Get the hell out.\n","707: \t Magath told Keith he will be remembered as a hero but how is anyone meant to know he sacrificed himself? Magath was the only one who knew he killed the reinforcements and both he and Keith are now in tiny pieces floating in the ocean. More likely no one will ever realise the crucial role Keith played and he will soon be forgotten, not special and not a hero, just like he always feared. I wish he had joined the fight just a couple minutes earlier so the others would have known what he did.\n","\n","The fighting scenes were awesome this episode, Mikasa and Connie were badass af. I wish Floch had a little bit of a more dramatic death though. If I’m not forgetting anyone Gabi’s kill count now includes; Sasha, Eren (kinda), Nile and Floch. What a beast.\n","708: \t Holy shit. What an episode.\n","\n","When Eren got shot in the head by Magath and Pieck I was going to crack a joke about \"I don't know why he even grows a head any more, it's just a target\" because between Pieck, Reiner, the Warhammer Titan, all he's done is get it shot or smashed off. I wasn't expect him to lose his ACTUAL head through a crack shot from Gabby. I'm really glad we had the slow mo through the city after that because not only did it look beautiful I think it took me about that long to process and accept the fact that had actually happened. There's also a really twisted parallel in Eren dropping the ball and Zeke catching his head.\n","\n","The way I see the brothers (quick rewrite of parts of an essay I wrote a couple of weeks ago);\n","\n","**Zeke** always was a fool though. He always thought that Eren was also his fathers son and could never see anything else. Zeke's entire life has been defined by the loss of his father and not just physically but in the father he wished he had beyond Grisha just training him, and how Grisha's loss completed the loss of the past he never got to have in a metaphorical sense, the loss of his childhood and the freedom to be a person beyond the role chosen for him by the world and his parents. After all of that he only found some measure of peace in connecting with another who also was so caught up in the pain of his past he was willing to sacrifice his future for any small grace he could give Zeke and those around him. To Zeke being Eldian is like having an umbilical cord always attached, it keeps him alive in the world with a purpose but it always stops his race from growing and stepping away from everything PATHS represents. All he wants is to sever that umbilical and give them all a chance to live without being bound to the horrors in their past that he sees them as being doomed to repeat, as he's seen in war and as he thinks in Eren.\n","\n","**Eren** is very different though. He lost his future when his parents died, not his past, he lost the chance to be anything but a solider the way Carla had hoped for him. He was safe and that let him explore the idea of being a solider in a way Zeke never got the chance too, to explore the idea of breaking out of what was holding them back, while Zeke only wanted to be allowed to find comfort in what he had within his walls without being pushed outside. Though Eren didn't always know how to keep pushing himself forward, anger often failed him and he didn't understand his place, he had to keep going to try and reclaim a future that both him and his people lost. The only thing he has to offer is what he learnt from his mother, the right of being born into the world, and when Willy said that at the festival he unknowing reinforced to Eren that this path of his, the cost of it, may be justified even if he doesn't always know what he's pushing forward too, because just like the ocean things don't always have a neat spot to end.\n","\n","Given the episode, having those two brothers conflict brought to the forefront and played off Falco and Colt, Porco and Marcel, was really nicely done, especially with the elder acting for the sake of family while the younger always acts for the future of others. Reiner's basically the only one without a brother, and in a twisted way that doesn't give him anything to fight after of all this. My heart broke seeing Zeke transform everyone, especially Falco and Niles, and [it looking like a bombing](https://imgur.com/dV6N1XM) was beautifully twisted. Though given Falco's memories not being from who we expected, the whole flying around with swords thing from the start of p1, I'm ~~curious if this means memories can go to any Eldian somehow, or if he will end up merging some Titans himself~~ Edit: Forgot about our Ymir and he would have her memories once removed now, poor Ymir.\n","\n","The art in this episode overall felt really good though, [even moments like this parallax](https://imgur.com/GZkFknn) stood out, and all the [Titans in the smoke](https://imgur.com/YHm6CS5). I thought the days of Titans being a threat felt long gone, or at least no longer intimidating to us as an audience, but knowing who these are makes it so much worse, a bit like rewatching Trost after knowing who they once were as well\n","\n","I have no bloody idea what's coming next, but I'm along for the ride\n","709: \t All of that close explosion and Levi only a couple of fingers with some scars on his face?\n","\n","Lmaaaaaaaao the last thing I expected was that face from Connie.\n","\n","If Erwin was in the same situation as Armin he would have killed Connie's mom for sure,no?\n","\n","Sorry Jean I almost doubted you, his speech about the bones not forgiving him, that's some Erwin line, he becoming more and more closer to the definition of a leader.\n","\n","The final scene pose was cool af, really looking forward to what's happening next.\n","712: \t Okay so I have a couple questions that came about with this episode.\n","1) How did Reiner see the memory of Marcel telling him he wasn’t supposed to be the Armored Titan? Because the memory looks like it is from the perspective of Marcel telling Reiner the information. \n","2) Why would Zeke want to sterilize Eldians and then unleash the Rumbling? In the long run, there will be no offspring to pass on the Nine Titans to eventually. So that means there will just be roaming Paradis Island aimlessly with no one to really control them if the Founding Titan eventually dies out. It seems like a quick fix for the problem but wouldn’t really help in the long run.\n","3) Why not instead of sterilizing the Eldians, just alter the DNA of Eldians/Subjects of Ymir in order to take out the Titan gene out completely? Because they could easily keep the Nine Titans out of that command in order to protect Eldians on Paradis Island while they live out their lives.\n","715: \t Hange was definitely lying. Levi has got to survive this.\n","\n","I don't how the fuck they are gonna turn this around. Marley came back with a vengeance and it looks like basically all of the Jaegerists just died. I'm glad everyone is realizing that Eren must have some other motive, and even Onyankopon was betrayed by Yelena.\n","719: \t [Aristeia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristeia) is the scene in epic fiction where a hero performs his greatest feats of martial prowess, most often hinging on an incredible emotional event or personal drama. Achilles, for example, in his rage for the loss of Patroclus, slays so many Trojans that he chokes the river god with blood. \n","\n","I think this episode showed Mikasa's Aristeia. After discovering and hating the predestination of her bloodline, she's called to turn on her comrades to save the world of people who hate her. She's rejected Eren, her previous reason for existence, and has only one thing left to her character: the fight. \n","\n","She turns her unmatched Titan-fighting skills against the humans she'd fought with before, and demonstrates that they undoubtedly transfer. Her power is quick, brutal, merciless, and unapologetic. I'd be surprised if we see her go so far again.\n","720: \t At first I didn't realize who those two Jaegerists were, but when he said \"promised we'd all eat meat together\" and I realized he was on the wall that day with Eren and Sasha and Conny it hit like a tonne of bricks and some. Of all the people to end up confronting, to have to test their ideals against... Shit just keeps getting worse and worse for Conny.\n","\n","Those two didn't join the scouts, and I can't imagine what it must been like for them to have Eren rise up to be this hero once out of their sight, only to turn around once they felt safe and find everyone else they knew from those days is now working with the people who broke down the wall. That Connie and Armin never tried to turn it around and accuse them of being traitors knowing how they must feel only hurt more because they're both compassionate people who've lost and want nothing more than this to be over just like those two did, but this isn't the way.\n","\n","In the same way I like the idea of Gabi's eyes judging Magath, and the path he will take from here. Not just an Eldian, or a Warrior, or a solider, but a child who will build a future off what comes about here the same way that the present world was built off broken children in the past. He's also trying to stop the cycle in his own way, and it's not an easy thing to do. \"The world will shrink\" is really the best way to sum this situation up.\n","\n","Also I see Annie is still crushing and kicking people, nothing's changed there. Not even her clothes, surely they have to be smelly by now?\n","\n","Seeing grown up haggard Reiner getting back into ODM gear is almost surreal though. It just doesn't look right that after all this time he's back in it and fighting with them.\n","721: \t So my guess is Zeke is badly injured but obviously not dead as the anti-titan round just mangled his real body again but didn't really hit him right on to kill him.  I think it was Magath that exclaimed not to let Zeke scream, which is foreshadowing that he will scream as a last ditch effort to win the battle now that he is down and Eren is pretty much done for other than to limp towards Zeke.\n","\n","So all those soldiers that escaped (military police and garrison members) will all turn into titans and so will Falco.  One of them, probably Falco will end up eating Zeke and become the new Beast.  But Eren will get to him first and start the rumbling.  At which point everyone will have to GTFO or be trampled by the wall titans since there is no more titan with royal blood to control them.  But I'm really interested to see how Annie comes into play here.  Will she suddenly appear out of nowhere and we get a flashback scene of someone (like Hitch) freeing her?  Or does she not re-appear until later?\n","\n","There's also Levi.  I think he's 100% alive, but what Hange's plan for him is idk.  If his father is an Eldian and he can go titan, probably use some titan serum.  Who he'd eat, no idea.  Or I had the theory last week that Ackermans respond completely differently to titan serum and it would just regenerate him in some manner.  Whatever it is, Yeagerists + Zeke have made it to Shiganshina on time so hopefully we'll get some sort of conclusion to Hange + Levi outcome next episode.  \n","\n","Eren will probably let go of the act and tell his friends what he's been trying to do.  Then Armin will devise an actual good plan based off of Eren's impulsive motivations.  What that entails, I have no theory for.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["display_metric(metrics[3]) # FN"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"tNGP4-CBPcMF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1650275767471,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Ryan Tran","userId":"14098298700710797497"}},"outputId":"72d9c0bb-645e-41cc-a486-36fa57d58769"},"execution_count":83,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Missed irrelevants: 23\n","\n","13: \t My only concern is that they didn't seem to give Falco any time at all to practice with the Jaw. He hasn't even used it once, right? Seems unwise to go into a fight against anti-titan gear with a 100% noob titan on your team\n","24: \t Doubt this would happen but just imagine if somehow Levi gets the juice and eats Falco, acquiring Jaw. Jesus the power\n","42: \t how does Floch go from being a coward in battle to one of a scheming leader? That's a 180 degree change!\n","\n","Also, Eren's life mission went from killing all titans to killing every human on earth except those on the island...\n","102: \t Ok one thing I just thought about is how are new titans being created right now?  Ymir had previously been making the titans as a slave but now she has a choice and would knowingly be helping Armin/Reiner/Falco/Annie stop Eren from completing his goal.  So she'd be actively fucking Eren and herself over presuming that she wants the same thing that Eren wants.\n","132: \t One thing i really love about the Rumbling as a concept is theres just something very eerily methodical about it. Theres no aggression to the Colossals like regular pure titans, there not chasing down people to deliberately harm them but at the same time they just instill a feeling of utter HOPELESSNESS. Like imagine if you looked outside right now and saw an army of Giants slowly marching towards you. Theres literally nowhere to run and nothing to do and if they crushed you it would be an instant death sure, but at the same time you'd have plenty of time to attempt running or hiding or finding your loved ones or just fucking Panic.\n","\n","Theyre not really Attacking they just....keep...moving ....Forward \n","\n","OHHHHH I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE ISAYAMA\n","227: \t Who was the blonde girl with the new 3D maneuver gear that Mikasa saved? She appeared once before a few episodes ago and said I think one line to one of the OG squad. Might be because of MAPPA's art style but I can't recognize her for my life.\n","243: \t Can the shifters still transform? Isn’t Ymir done building Titan bodies? Technically they shouldn’t be able to transform right?\n","269: \t I wanted to ask this question last week but I forgot. Was the desert area where the girl was repairing Zeke the same place Ymir woke up in when she first ate the Jaw? The night sky looked exactly the same but it could just be literally any night sky. But it just gives off the same vibes\n","296: \t Does anyone remember when Eren tried to stop Zeke from screaming just 2 episodes ago? Can we assume that he cares for the safety of the people of Paradis and that if he could undo the titan transformation or even command pure titans, he would simply just do it right away? This makes me believe Eren is not the one who is in charge. Perhaps he is just borrowing a limited part of Ymir's power and does not have full access to the whole package.\n","371: \t Hold on. If all titans are hand constructed by Ymir, and Ymir is free now, can new titans even be made? Can Shifters still even shift?\n","406: \t How would Eren react to the Yeagerists/Floch if they killed Mikasa, Connie, Armin, etc.??\n","434: \t Eren fuck you zeke eldians rule\n","\n","Zeke hehe muther fucker i have the power you traitor! lets touch heads and then you will see how much your dad sucks dick\n","\n","Eren no.\n","\n","Zeke what?\n","\n","Eren i have the power now bitch.\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","*\\*Eren litteraly fucks the fucking shit up\\**\n","442: \t Weird thing to be fixated on , but they showed Grisha so I figured I could ask. How does Grisha inject Eren the same day Wall Maria falls but doesn’t know the fate of his wife? Like how does he even find Eren in all the chaos. Unless I’m missing something\n","457: \t I think some people might have noticed the episode of this part doesn't have same aura as an attack on titan episode of past.\n","The stakes are non existent as all the people in screen are plot armoured and conjure no tension or stake. Its not necessary to have some expandable chr to just raise the stake but all the drama behind recent episode falls flat. For example the recent connys dilemma with kill his comrades of scouts. It doesn't hit at all. I understand the logic behind dilemma but we do not have any connection with yaegerist, we never had. The writer seriously didn't considered a cent when making the antagonist the yaegerist, from their emergence in part 1 to this episode they are really annoying whenever on scree and special that ducking floc. He is not that type of villain like cersei or joffery that you love to hate he is just some random ass side chr who  have been raised to become main antagonist with any time to build him. If instead of floc some real main chr had been mastermind of yaegerist faction and have real stakes it would have been bearable. \n","All recent episodes are really average and I never wanna see an average AoT episode.\n","483: \t Damn, that was a good episode! So many things happened and I really wish the episodes were double the time. We're building up to this for a while now as to what the outcome of the contact will be, so I'm pretty sure Eren is going to make contact with Zeke somehow. My guess out of the two possibilities that we know of, one being euthanasia and the other Rumbling would be Rumbling, Rumbling, Rumbling \\*if I lose it all slip and fall\\*. And also since Euthanasia would be a rather suicidal decision for Eren and also the plot - I don't really see it going this way. Although some of my friends did point out that the Rumbling would also be absolute destruction as it would unleash hundreds of colossal titans on to the world..which again is a bizarre one sided end. I'm so excited to see what happens when Eren takes the next 5 steps!\n","489: \t Anime only, here's how I would have preferred this to go after thinking about it for a few hours\n","\n","Annie is riding south from ~~Stohess~~ Trost. Connie is riding Northwest to Ragako. While they were doing the final titan hunt, a chunk of them broke away from the fort and started moving inland  since there are no walls anymore. This gives Armin a double reason to follow Connie: Get Falco back, and kill the Titans, since he can do it safely in his colossal form. He has a dilemma to go after the Titans or Connie, and he chooses Connie first. \n","\n","Connie doesn't rest in the woods. He arrives at Ragako and camps there while he has a Walter White vs Krazy 8 situation, agonizing over whether he can pull this off. I like this better, because Gabi and Armin don't heroically ride in conveniently at the last second, they have time to catch up because he's wrestling with himself over whether he can do it. After that situation is resolved, they start riding back and see some lightning off in the distance, and ride towards it. Annie had transformed to defend Hitch from the rogue titans, killing them, and it's a very tense moment because Connie is extremely worked up already, but Armin negotiates the situation for now and they ride back to Shiganshina. \n","\n","Mikasa would probably be super angry at Annie still and have unsettled scores. I know there's a lot of show left to explore these things, but I don't think anyone would disagree that this episode could have been handled better\n","539: \t I do like how the show did a complete 180 from Season 3 to 4. It definitely made things more interesting, widened the scope of the world, and brought in higher stakes. HOWEVER, the dilemmas the characters face in this season are much more simple than the ones in other seasons. In the first few it was complicated, moral dilemmas about how to save humanity if we have to sacrifice our own. Erwin deciding to sacrifice the lives of almost all the scouts, Eren deciding to change into a Titan after Annie killed the Levi Squad, and Bertholdt/Reiner's reluctance to betray their friends. All of these were dilemmas that never had simple answers. Now it's simply, should we kill the entire world or not? The answer is obvious. I sympathize with Erens cause, but the lengths they're going to are insane. Killing the entire world is not the solution, and I don't understand why the show wants me to think that it is. I will always root for Mikasa, Armin, Connie, etc. They want to save everyone, but the problems in this show aren't as complex as they used to be. \n","Also, is anyone else upset with Armin and Mikasa character treatment after Season 3? Really felt like they dropped the ball with what to do with them.\n","567: \t Why did Eren need the Warhammer titan to do this when all he needed was Zeke? He wanted to protect eldians but basically slaughtered heaps by starting this war. To top it all off, you now have Reiner and Falco inside the wars ready to fuck with Eren.\n","572: \t So I guess Erén still has a lot of fans here cuz I see lots of comments worried about him. \n","\n","Meanwhile here I am worried to death about Reiner, Pieck and Porco. I hope my warriors come out of this battle alive. Specially my main guy Reiner\n","638: \t All the characters saying that Reiners brain screwed because of guilt but I’m thinking maybe it’s because of the amount of times he has been punched and kicks in the head since he was a kid\n","691: \t Interesting thought here. Remember when Eren was first discovered to be a titan, and Shadis almost killed him with a cannon? In that moment Eren somehow had a flashback to Grisha right before he gets eaten, telling him to harness the power he is given. \n","\n","I wonder if Eren sent this memory to himself at the time, as he was then able to save himself from the cannon. If so, Isayama is a god for this level of detail.\n","695: \t What I don't understand, is why Armin doesn't just transform? The explosion shouldn't be an issue since it can be controlled like it was in the very first episode the wall also not blowing up.\n","701: \t This was amazing. \n","\n","The intro and outro are the best ones from the 6 seasons, both musically and visually.\n","\n","But it's so sad to see the eldians fight between themselves. I was convinced, as Armin and the others are, that Eren had a plan and was manipulating Yelena and Zeke, but now that i saw that he was ok with killing Hange and Levi I really don't know what to think. The only thing that cheers me up is that since the Eldians have suffered a lot in this episode, it will be the Marleyans time next.\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","Also a tiny detail i noted. In the outro, at a certain point Eren seems to have Mikasas black eyes instead of his blue-green eyes. I don't understand it but it's there.\n","\n","And then we see the insides of the wall abandoned and reclaimed by nature...  I just hope the people inside the walls survive. Whoever can save them, be it Eren or the military government, has my support.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"mhNsEYvRQcEM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1650267091652,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":198,"user":{"displayName":"Ryan Tran","userId":"14098298700710797497"}}},"execution_count":38,"outputs":[]}]}

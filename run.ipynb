INFO - src.dataset -   text: <s>[Comment]: Finally watched it. This episode was way better. I loved Jeans inner struggle to choose between the world and himself/future family. Is that Mikasa he was imagining being married to? I saw a scar on her cheek. Hange was kinda weird. She claims she isn't their superior and then says shes still the commander of the survey corps. She points that all the dead soldiers wouldnt agree with genocide but what about the yeagerist. Many of them were once cadets or in the new survey corps and they agreed with the rumbling why would all the dead soldiers who only knew that humanity lived within the walls fight for the rest of humanity which forced them in this situation, Kinda nitpicky but what I noticed. At 3:20 jean says they tried for years looking for answers. Years: the 4-year timeskip. At 7:57 Hange says they lived in the outside world. This basically comfirms that they tried diplomacy. The only reason hange would have a true reason to go would be to prevent the rumbling. Magaths argument is so weak it just reminds me of gabis argument. I was hoping gabi would of said. Did you see that happen? Armin is naive to think Eren is going to stop at this point. Eren is likely to destroy the entire world. Pieck in titan form is a threat to all of them im sure. Jean kicking Reiner for what he did was truly satisfying. Reiner is spitting death flags at all times I wonder when he'll die. Though the trees were shown about 140000 times(i counted) The way Yelena tore apart the alliance was the best way i could of hoped to be delivered. 8/10 for me :). [Summary]: The night before, while most people are asleep, Hange Zoë interrupts Jean Kirschtein's fantasy of a pleasant life in the interior to call him out for a meeting. Despite his misgivings, he goes out to meet Hange and Mikasa Ackermann, who brings them up to speed on Levi Ackermann's condition and their new alliance with some stragglers from Marley. Hange plans on stopping Eren Jaeger's plans for genocide, but first they will need more allies. Mikasa is immediately in, but Jean is concerned about the aftermath, since even if they stop him, the world will still hate Eldians and Eren will only.

INFO - src.dataset -   text: <s>▁Also<mask>. Finally watched it. This episode was way better. I loved Jeans inner struggle to choose between the world and himself/future family. Is that Mikasa he was imagining being married to? I saw a scar on her cheek. Hange was kinda weird. She claims she isn't their superior and then says shes still the commander of the survey corps. She points that all the dead soldiers wouldnt agree with genocide but what about the yeagerist. Many of them were once cadets or in the new survey corps and they agreed with the rumbling why would all the dead soldiers who only knew that humanity lived within the walls fight for the rest of humanity which forced them in this situation, Kinda nitpicky but what I noticed. At 3:20 jean says they tried for years looking for answers. Years: the 4-year timeskip. At 7:57 Hange says they lived in the outside world. This basically comfirms that they tried diplomacy. The only reason hange would have a true reason to go would be to prevent the rumbling. Magaths argument is so weak it just reminds me of gabis argument. I was hoping gabi would of said. Did you see that happen? Armin is naive to think Eren is going to stop at this point. Eren is likely to destroy the entire world. Pieck in titan form is a threat to all of them im sure. Jean kicking Reiner for what he did was truly satisfying. Reiner is spitting death flags at all times I wonder when he'll die. Though the trees were shown about 140000 times(i counted) The way Yelena tore apart the alliance was the best way i could of hoped to be delivered. 8/10 for me
